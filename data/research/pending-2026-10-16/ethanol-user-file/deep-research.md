## Summary

Ethanol (ethyl alcohol) is the psychoactive alcohol in beer, wine and spirits. Acute human experiments show dose- and time-dependent subjective sedation, sometimes accompanied by stimulant-like ratings on the rising blood-alcohol curve, and measurable psychomotor impairment. Regular or sustained exposure is linked to liver and brain injury, can raise blood pressure, and can produce alcohol use disorder, physical dependence and potentially life-threatening withdrawal. Official pregnancy guidance states that no safe amount or safe time for alcohol use in pregnancy is known.

## Description

The parent molecule is PubChem CID 702, formula C2H6O and molecular weight 46.07 g/mol. “Beverage alcohol” refers here to ethanol delivered in beer, wine, spirits or experimental beverage formulations; those matrices are not chemically identical to pure ethanol and can change absorption context. Research doses below are experimental ethanol exposures, often normalized to body mass, not serving guidance. Ethanol is distributed in body water and is eliminated mainly by hepatic oxidation to acetaldehyde; because elimination becomes capacity-limited, a single first-order half-life is a poor general description.

## Evidence note

Acute dose-response and interaction evidence includes small randomized or crossover laboratory studies, while the liver and brain harm records rely on large but observational cohorts and therefore retain confounding and self-report limitations. Pregnancy exposure cannot ethically be randomized; the official precautionary position and a large cohort with both positive and null findings are kept separate. Several older pharmacology papers were available only as PubMed abstracts/metadata in this research pass, so their funding and conflict declarations remain unassessed. Null findings are retained where they narrow claims: 0.2 g/kg produced negligible subjective effects in one acute study; lower acute exposures did not impair every psychomotor or memory endpoint; a pregnancy cohort found no association with preterm birth; and a low-dose benzodiazepine interaction experiment did not show potentiation or prolonged action despite additive impairment on one measure.

## Pharmacokinetics

```yaml
- id: ethanol-unresolved
  analyte: Ethanol
  route: Systemic
  formulation: Ethanol
  population: Humans
  endpoint: elimination-half-life
  statistic: not-established
  value: null
  low: null
  high: null
  unit: hours
  context: Clinical pharmacokinetic modeling describes concentration-dependent, capacity-limited elimination rather than one stable first-order half-life; a zero-order approximation also has limitations.
  sourceId: holford1987
  modelEligible: false
```

## Modifiers

```yaml
- label: Food or meal timing
  effect: Lower peak blood ethanol and faster disappearance in one controlled crossover
  detail: After 0.80 g/kg, mean peak BAC was 67 mg/dL after breakfast versus 104 mg/dL fasting; AUC was also lower, and the reported disappearance rate increased after food. Ten healthy men were studied, so no fixed personal correction factor is justified.

## Effects

```yaml
- id: ethanol-subjective-sedation
  conceptId: drowsiness
  name: Sedative-like subjective response
  direction: Variable
  evidence: Human research
  description: In a randomized double-blind crossover, 0.2 g/kg produced negligible subjective effects versus placebo; 0.4 g/kg increased sedative-like ratings at 90 minutes; 0.8 g/kg increased both stimulant-like and sedative-like ratings on the ascending limb and only sedative-like ratings on the descending limb. Roughly half of participants showed the expected stimulant-then-sedative pattern, indicating marked individual variability.
  sourceId: holdstock1998
  population: 49 healthy nonproblem social drinkers aged 21–35
  exposure: Placebo or ethanol 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8 g/kg orally

## Outcomes

```yaml
- id: ethanol-reaction-time-1983
  conceptId: reaction-time
  name: Simple reaction time
  direction: Increased
  evidence: Human research
  description: Ethanol 0.4 g/kg alone significantly slowed simple reaction time for 30–60 minutes. In the same experiment ethanol alone had no detectable effect on immediate recall, prompted recall, learning or word recognition.
  sourceId: taberner1983
  population: 10 healthy male volunteers
  exposure: Ethanol 0.4 g/kg with placebo benzodiazepine condition
  instrument: Simple reaction-time and memory test battery
  magnitude: Significant reaction-time slowing at 30–60 minutes; the PubMed abstract did not report a numerical effect size.
  reportType: measured-assessment
  conflictingSourceIds: []
- id: ethanol-psychomotor-dose-1991
  conceptId: reaction-time
  name: Psychomotor test-battery performance
  direction: Variable
  evidence: Human research
  description: At 1.0 g/kg, effects were evident across the computerized psychomotor battery; at 0.5 g/kg, only coordination was significantly impaired one hour after drinking. The lower exposure therefore did not impair every measured domain.
  sourceId: nuotto1991
  population: 12 healthy volunteers
  exposure: Ethanol 0.5 or 1.0 g/kg orally
  instrument: Computerized hand-eye coordination, attention and reaction-skills battery

## Mechanisms

```yaml
- title: Capacity-limited hepatic oxidation
  description: Ethanol is metabolized mainly in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenase to acetaldehyde. Clinical pharmacokinetic modeling describes a concentration-dependent process analogous to Michaelis–Menten kinetics, which is why one fixed first-order half-life is not used here.
  sourceId: holford1987
- title: NMDA-receptor current inhibition
  description: In voltage-clamped hippocampal neurons, ethanol inhibited NMDA-activated current concentration-dependently from 5 to 50 mM; 50 mM reduced NMDA current by 61%, more than kainate- or quisqualate-activated currents in that preparation. This cellular experiment does not establish the magnitude of a human clinical effect.
  sourceId: lovinger1989
- title: GABA-A receptor response variability
  description: In 250 healthy people given 0.5 g/kg orally, GABRA4 rs2229940 was associated with reaction-time response to ethanol, while GABRA6 rs4454083 related to motor time but not the ethanol-induced change; multiple other tested GABA-A receptor missense variants were null after correction. Association does not identify a universal ethanol binding site.

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Liver cirrhosis
  description: In 401,806 UK women who drank at least weekly, cirrhosis incidence rose with amount consumed; at 15 or more drinks per week (mean 220 g alcohol) versus 1–2 drinks (mean 30 g), adjusted RR was 3.43 (95% CI 2.87–4.10). Daily drinking and drinking without meals were additional observational risk markers. Self-report and residual confounding prevent treating meal timing as a protective intervention.
  sourceId: simpson2019
- title: Brain structure and cognitive decline
  description: In the Whitehall II imaging substudy, higher long-term intake was associated with hippocampal atrophy and white-matter differences; 14–<21 UK units/week was associated with right hippocampal atrophy versus abstinence (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.4–8.1). No protective association was found for 1–<7 units/week, and no association was found with cross-sectional cognition, semantic-fluency decline or word recall. Imaging was endpoint observational data with residual-confounding and representativeness limits.
  sourceId: topiwala2017
- title: Blood pressure and cardiovascular burden
  description: In 46 normotensive male drinkers, randomized reduction from about 336 to 65 mL ethanol/week lowered systolic blood pressure; the mean difference during the final two weeks was 3.8 mmHg and pressure rose when usual drinking resumed. The short male-only trial measured blood pressure, not cardiovascular events.
  sourceId: puddey1985
- title: Dependence and withdrawal
  description: NIAAA describes alcohol use disorder as including tolerance and withdrawal and warns that sudden cessation after chronic heavy drinking can produce potentially life-threatening withdrawal, including seizures and delirium tremens. This official clinical synthesis does not predict an individual withdrawal course from ethanol dose alone.
  sourceId: niaaa-aud-2025
- title: Pregnancy
  description: CDC states that no known safe amount or safe time for alcohol use during pregnancy has been established and that beer, wine and liquor can all be harmful; prenatal exposure can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.
  sourceId: cdc-pregnancy-2026
- title: Pregnancy cohort findings are endpoint-specific
  description: In 10,851 pregnancies, binge exposure defined as 5 UK units (40 g alcohol) was associated with small-for-gestational-age birth (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.15–2.47), while moderate drinking was not associated with either studied birth outcome and binge drinking was not associated with preterm birth. These observational null findings do not establish a safe prenatal threshold or address neurodevelopmental outcomes.
