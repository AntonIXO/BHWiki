## Summary

Diphenhydramine is a first-generation H1 antihistamine with clinically important central sedative effects and additional antimuscarinic activity. Current U.S. oral Drug Facts products reviewed here separately label it for allergy symptoms and for occasional sleeplessness, while a current prescription injection label includes allergic indications and active treatment of motion sickness when oral therapy is impractical. Sedation is therefore both a pharmacologic effect and, in sleep-aid products, part of the intended use; it does not imply preserved cognition, safe driving, or restorative sleep. (`diphenhydramine-allergy-label`, `diphenhydramine-sleep-label`, `diphenhydramine-injection-label`, `tashiro2008`, `liu2005`)

## Description

Diphenhydramine crosses into the central nervous system and occupies brain H1 receptors; in a small PET crossover experiment, 30 mg orally produced mean cortical H1-receptor occupancy of 56.4%. Separate preclinical receptor-function work demonstrates muscarinic antagonism, providing a mechanistic basis for its drying and other anticholinergic effects, although that assay cannot quantify human cognitive toxicity. (`tashiro2008`, `liu2005`)

The reviewed U.S. allergy product contains 25 mg diphenhydramine hydrochloride per capsule and labels temporary relief of specified allergy and common-cold symptoms. The reviewed U.S. sleep product contains 25 mg diphenhydramine hydrochloride per LiquiCap and labels occasional sleeplessness, with two LiquiCaps at bedtime as its labeled dose for people aged 12 years and older. These indications should not be collapsed into a generic “sedative” indication. (`diphenhydramine-allergy-label`, `diphenhydramine-sleep-label`)

Motion-sickness status is formulation-specific. The two reviewed oral OTC Drug Facts labels do not list motion sickness among their uses, so using those products for motion sickness is outside those reviewed labeled indications. In contrast, the current U.S. prescription injection label specifically includes active treatment of motion sickness when oral therapy is impractical. A small randomized ambulance-transport trial of 50 mg IV diphenhydramine found no significant symptom advantage over placebo at 15 minutes. (`diphenhydramine-allergy-label`, `diphenhydramine-sleep-label`, `diphenhydramine-injection-label`, `rubio2011`)

The displayed molecular identity is the parent diphenhydramine base, PubChem CID 3100, formula C17H21NO and molecular weight 255.35 g/mol. Clinical products and experiments cited below may instead administer a salt, most commonly diphenhydramine hydrochloride and, in one next-day driving study, diphenhydramine citrate. (`pubchem`)

## Evidence note

Healthy-volunteer performance findings are kept separate from findings in people with seasonal allergic rhinitis or insomnia. Subjective sleepiness or sedation is kept separate from measured driving, psychomotor, memory and polysomnographic outcomes. A serum elimination half-life is not treated as the duration of felt sedation.

The evidence is heterogeneous rather than uniformly positive or negative. A 25 mg placebo-controlled crossover experiment found no significant diphenhydramine-placebo difference in self-rated sedation, psychomotor performance or memory, whereas 50 mg experiments found acute driving or psychometric impairment. Repeated 50 mg twice-daily exposure produced rapid tolerance to measured daytime sedation and performance impairment in one small study, but that tolerance finding does not establish preserved safety, sustained insomnia benefit or absence of anticholinergic effects. (`scavone1998`, `vuurman2004`, `richardson2002`)

Insomnia evidence is also mixed. In adults with mild insomnia, 50 mg nightly produced some subjective improvement, including sleep efficiency, but no significant between-group differences in polysomnographic sleep-continuity variables. In an elderly-insomnia crossover study, 50 mg improved the reported number of awakenings versus placebo but not the broader set of sleep outcomes summarized in the abstract. (`morin2005`, `glass2008`)

A completed ClinicalTrials.gov driving study, NCT01411124, used diphenhydramine as an active control in healthy volunteers but had no posted results in the registry record retrieved for this review; it is therefore retained only as registry context, not as efficacy or safety evidence. (`ctg-nct01411124`)

Class-level antihistamine findings were not substituted for diphenhydramine-specific findings. Comparator substances appearing in trials below are not treated as interventions for this topic, and separate comparator arms are not misrepresented as coadministration interactions.

## Modifiers

```yaml
- label: Age-defined study group
  effect: Age effects were detected in one PK experiment but not another
  detail: A 1.25 mg/kg syrup study reported mean half-lives of 5.4 hours in children, 9.2 hours in young adults and 13.5 hours in older adults. A separate single-25 mg crossover study found no statistically significant influence of age or sex on the principal PK parameters. A fixed age multiplier is therefore not justified.
  sourceId: simons1990
  observationId: diphenhydramine-older-adult
  factorType: other
  direction: variable

- label: Hepatic function
  effect: Dedicated hepatic-impairment PK effect was not quantified in the reviewed evidence
  detail: Current U.S. injection labeling states that the portion not excreted unchanged in urine is metabolized via the liver, but it does not provide a hepatic-impairment exposure ratio or a validated impairment-specific half-life. Slower clearance should not be numerically inferred from this statement alone.
  sourceId: diphenhydramine-injection-label
  observationId: diphenhydramine-young-adult
  factorType: other
  direction: variable

- label: Renal function
  effect: Dedicated renal-impairment PK effect was not quantified in the reviewed evidence
  detail: Current injection labeling states that a portion of diphenhydramine is excreted unchanged in urine, but supplies no renal-impairment exposure estimate or validated renal adjustment. The available label statement is insufficient to derive a renal half-life multiplier.
  sourceId: diphenhydramine-injection-label
  observationId: diphenhydramine-young-adult
  factorType: other
  direction: variable

- label: Pregnancy
  effect: Pregnancy-specific human pharmacokinetics are not established in the reviewed sources
  detail: The current injection label reports animal reproduction findings and states that adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women are lacking. The reviewed OTC labels direct pregnant or breastfeeding users to a health professional. These statements do not quantify pregnancy-related changes in diphenhydramine exposure.

## Mechanisms

- title: Central histamine H1 receptor occupancy
  description: In eight healthy men studied with 11C-doxepin PET after crossover treatment, a single 30 mg oral diphenhydramine dose produced mean cortical H1-receptor occupancy of 56.4%. This directly demonstrates substantial central H1 engagement under the tested conditions but does not establish a universal occupancy value for other doses, ages or formulations.
  sourceId: tashiro2008
  conceptId: histamine-h1

- title: Antimuscarinic activity
  description: In cultured swine airway mucus-gland cells, diphenhydramine antagonized acetylcholine-driven muscarinic signaling, with a reported pA2 of 6.2 against the M3-mediated response. This supports intrinsic antimuscarinic pharmacology but cannot by itself quantify human cognitive, urinary, ocular or delirium risk.
  sourceId: liu2005
  conceptId: muscarinic-receptor
```

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Drowsiness, driving and machinery
  description: Current U.S. oral and injectable labeling warns that marked drowsiness can occur and cautions about driving or operating machinery. Controlled driving studies show that subjective drowsiness is not a reliable personal gauge of measured impairment.
  sourceId: diphenhydramine-allergy-label

- title: Next-day impairment can outlast the intended bedtime effect
  description: In a healthy-volunteer crossover trial, nighttime diphenhydramine citrate impaired a simulated-driving speed measure approximately 6.5 hours after dosing. Serum half-life and the duration of consciously felt sleepiness should therefore not be treated as interchangeable.
  sourceId: kay2016

- title: Anticholinergic susceptibility
  description: Prescription injection labeling describes diphenhydramine as having atropine-like activity and calls for caution in conditions including narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary obstruction or prostatic enlargement and certain respiratory or cardiovascular conditions. Older adults are described as more likely to experience dizziness, sedation and hypotension.
  sourceId: diphenhydramine-injection-label

- title: Toxic delirium-like effects, hallucinations and seizures
  description: Overdose labeling describes central nervous system depression or stimulation, hallucinations, convulsions and potentially fatal toxicity, with stimulation especially prominent in children. These toxic manifestations can include a delirium-like anticholinergic syndrome; the label does not provide an incidence estimate for delirium at therapeutic exposures.
  sourceId: diphenhydramine-injection-label

- title: Misuse and fatal-overdose context
  description: A forensic case series from two U.S. jurisdictions documented diphenhydramine in selected toxic and lethal investigations, including a rare fatal case involving intravenous abuse. The series is highly selected and cannot estimate population prevalence or a threshold that predicts death in an individual.
  sourceId: botch-jones2014

- title: Rapid tolerance to daytime sedation does not establish safety
  description: In 15 healthy men given 50 mg twice daily, excess sleepiness and performance impairment present on day 1 were no longer distinguishable from placebo by day 4. This finding is regimen-specific and does not demonstrate sustained insomnia efficacy, absence of antimuscarinic effects, or safe performance under other conditions.
  sourceId: richardson2002

- title: Persistent sleeplessness requires evaluation
  description: The reviewed U.S. OTC sleep-aid label states that sleeplessness persisting continuously for more than 2 weeks may indicate an underlying illness and directs the user to seek medical advice rather than continuing indefinite self-treatment.
  sourceId: diphenhydramine-sleep-label

- title: Children
  description: The reviewed U.S. allergy label states not to use diphenhydramine to make a child sleepy. Prescription labeling also warns that overdose in pediatric patients may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death and that excitation can occur.
  sourceId: diphenhydramine-allergy-label

- title: Pregnancy and breastfeeding are formulation-specific label contexts
  description: Reviewed OTC labels direct pregnant or breastfeeding users to consult a health professional. The reviewed prescription injection label states that adequate controlled pregnancy studies are lacking and lists nursing mothers among its contraindications. These statements should not be converted into a universal pregnancy or lactation safety estimate.

## Interactions

```yaml
- id: diphenhydramine-alcohol
  name: Alcohol
  otherSlug: null
  summary: Current U.S. oral labeling directs users to avoid alcoholic drinks, and prescription injection labeling states that alcohol can have an additive effect with diphenhydramine. A driving-simulator study compared diphenhydramine and alcohol in separate treatment periods; it did not test their coadministration and therefore is not evidence for a numeric combination effect.
  sourceId: diphenhydramine-allergy-label
  mechanism: Additive central sedation and impairment warning
  context: Regulatory labeling; comparator-only alcohol exposure in the driving literature must not be mistaken for combination exposure

  summary: Prescription labeling states that diphenhydramine has additive effects with other CNS depressants and specifically names hypnotics, sedatives and tranquilizers; OTC labeling likewise warns that sedatives or tranquilizers may increase drowsiness.
  sourceId: diphenhydramine-injection-label
  mechanism: Additive CNS depression and impairment

- id: diphenhydramine-opioid-context
  name: Opioids
  otherSlug: null
  summary: U.S. overdose surveillance documents opioid co-involvement in antihistamine-involved overdose deaths in which diphenhydramine was commonly identified. This observational co-involvement does not prove a specific pharmacodynamic effect size for diphenhydramine plus an opioid and should be interpreted alongside the diphenhydramine label's broader warning about CNS depressants.
  sourceId: cdc-antihistamine-overdose-2022
  mechanism: Overdose co-involvement and potential additive CNS-depressant context
  context: Population-level overdose surveillance rather than a controlled coadministration trial

- id: diphenhydramine-anticholinergic-burden
  name: Other anticholinergic medicines
  otherSlug: null
  summary: Diphenhydramine itself has atropine-like and experimentally demonstrated antimuscarinic activity. The reviewed evidence does not provide a controlled human interaction estimate for arbitrary combinations with other anticholinergic medicines, so additive anticholinergic burden is retained as a mechanistic caution rather than assigned a numeric effect.
  sourceId: diphenhydramine-injection-label
  mechanism: Potential additive antimuscarinic effects

  otherSlug: null
  summary: In a randomized human interaction study, diphenhydramine reduced metoprolol oral and nonrenal clearance approximately twofold and partial metabolic clearance approximately 2.5-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, with no corresponding significant effect in poor metabolizers. Metoprolol cardiovascular effects were more pronounced and prolonged in the extensive-metabolizer diphenhydramine condition. The magnitude should not be generalized unchanged to every CYP2D6 substrate.

  insight: Diphenhydramine competitively inhibited CYP2D6-mediated metoprolol metabolism; in extensive metabolizers it reduced oral and nonrenal metoprolol clearance approximately twofold and partial metabolic clearance approximately 2.5-fold, with no corresponding significant effect in poor metabolizers.
  limitation: Metoprolol-specific probe study in a small genotype-stratified healthy sample; interaction magnitude cannot be transferred unchanged to every CYP2D6 substrate.
  funding: PubMed indexes non-U.S.-government research support, but a complete full-text funding declaration was not inspected.

  title: "Motion sickness: comparison of metoclopramide and diphenhydramine to placebo"
  authors: Stephanie Rubio; Lori Weichenthal; Jim Andrews
  year: 2011
  pmid: "22008228"
  doi: 10.1017/S1049023X11006431
  url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22008228/
  kind: Prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled patient trial
  insight: Among 22 ambulance patients randomized after motion sickness developed, seven received 50 mg IV diphenhydramine; diphenhydramine was not significantly better than placebo at 15 minutes.
  limitation: Extremely small treatment groups, rescue medication after 15 minutes and a distinctive mountainous ambulance setting limit precision and generalizability.

  year: 2014
  pmid: "25051196"
  doi: 10.1097/PAF.0000000000000106
  url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25051196/
  kind: Forensic case series
  insight: Describes selected toxic and lethal death investigations involving diphenhydramine in two U.S. jurisdictions and includes a documented fatal intravenous-abuse case.
  limitation: Case selection was restricted to toxic or lethal investigations where diphenhydramine was causal or contributory; it cannot estimate population misuse prevalence or define a universally lethal blood concentration.

  title: "Antihistamine Positivity and Involvement in Drug Overdose Deaths — 44 Jurisdictions, United States, 2019–2020"
  authors: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
  year: 2022
  url: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7141a4.htm
  kind: U.S. public-health overdose surveillance report
  insight: Documents diphenhydramine as a prominent antihistamine in overdose-death toxicology and describes frequent co-involvement of other drugs, including opioids, providing real-world interaction context without establishing causality.
  limitation: Postmortem surveillance is observational, subject to jurisdictional testing and coding practices, and cannot quantify a causal pharmacodynamic interaction between diphenhydramine and an opioid.
  funding: U.S. federal public-health surveillance publication; no study-specific external funding declaration was assessed for this article.
  sponsorshipStatus: not-assessed
  conflictsOfInterest: A separate study-level conflict declaration was not assessed for this review.

  authors: XenoPort, Inc.; ClinicalTrials.gov
  year: 2011
  url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01411124
  kind: ClinicalTrials.gov registry record
  insight: Registers a completed double-blind placebo- and active-controlled crossover driving study in 36 healthy volunteers in which diphenhydramine was an active control; the retrieved registry record had no posted results.
  limitation: Sponsor-submitted registry information is not a peer-reviewed outcome report, and absence of posted registry results is not evidence of no effect.
  funding: XenoPort, Inc. is listed as the lead sponsor.
  sponsorshipStatus: industry-funded
  conflictsOfInterest: ClinicalTrials.gov does not provide a publication-style author conflict-of-interest declaration for this record.
