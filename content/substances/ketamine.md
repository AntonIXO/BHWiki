  onset: With labeled anesthetic dosing, an average 2 mg/kg IV ketamine dose produces surgical anesthesia within about 30 seconds; 9–13 mg/kg IM generally produces surgical anesthesia within 3–4 minutes.
  peak: Not established as a plasma Tmax in the cited KETALAR label.
  duration: The labeled anesthetic effect is about 5–10 minutes after an average 2 mg/kg IV induction dose and 12–25 minutes after 9–13 mg/kg IM.
  bioavailability: The cited KETALAR label does not establish absolute bioavailability for non-IV racemic-ketamine routes.
  metabolism: Ketamine undergoes N-dealkylation to active norketamine, primarily through CYP2B6 and CYP3A4; norketamine is subsequently hydroxylated and conjugated.

## Summary

Ketamine is a chiral arylcyclohexylamine used clinically as a dissociative general anesthetic. The U.S. KETALAR product is racemic ketamine: a mixture containing both ketamine enantiomers. Esketamine is the S-enantiomer and is marketed separately as intranasal SPRAVATO. KETALAR is approved for anesthesia, not depression; SPRAVATO is approved in U.S. adults for treatment-resistant depression, as monotherapy or with an oral antidepressant, and for depressive symptoms in major depressive disorder with acute suicidal ideation or behavior when used with an oral antidepressant. The SPRAVATO label specifically states that prevention of suicide or reduction of suicidal ideation or behavior has not been demonstrated. Sources: ketalar-label, spravato-label.

Human evidence supports rapid short-term antidepressant effects after a single 0.5 mg/kg IV racemic-ketamine infusion in selected treatment-resistant depression populations and after repeated intranasal esketamine in treatment-resistant depression. Perioperative IV ketamine also produces small average reductions in acute postoperative pain and opioid consumption across randomized trials. Dissociation, sedation and transient blood-pressure elevation are prominent acute effects. Recurrent or high exposure is associated with abuse and dependence, urinary-tract injury and hepatobiliary injury; important neuropsychiatric and respiratory adverse effects are also documented in labeling. Sources: murrough-2013, janik-2025, brinck-2018, ketalar-label, spravato-label.

## Description

Ketamine has molecular formula C13H16ClNO and molecular weight 237.72 g/mol as the free base; injectable KETALAR contains ketamine hydrochloride. KETALAR labeling identifies the drug as a racemic mixture, whereas SPRAVATO contains esketamine, the S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine. Sources: pubchem, ketalar-label, spravato-label.

Ketamine produces a dissociative anesthetic state with analgesia and characteristic perceptual and neuropsychiatric effects. Its established anesthetic use and the depression indications of intranasal esketamine are distinct regulatory uses and should not be conflated. Racemic IV ketamine has depression-trial evidence, but the cited KETALAR U.S. label does not include depression as an indication. Sources: ketalar-label, spravato-label, murrough-2013.

## Evidence note

The strongest indication-level evidence here comes from current U.S. prescribing information and randomized human studies. The racemic-ketamine depression trial used a single infusion, selected medication-free participants and brief follow-up; its day-7 between-group advantage was no longer statistically significant. The esketamine monotherapy trial was industry-funded, sponsor-involved and vulnerable to functional unblinding because characteristic effects made treatment assignment recognizable to many participants. The postoperative-pain evidence aggregates heterogeneous operations, doses and small trials and shows modest average effects rather than a universal analgesic effect. Safety labeling combines clinical-trial and postmarketing evidence, so some uncommon-event frequencies and causal magnitudes cannot be estimated.

```

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Cardiovascular effects
  description: Ketamine frequently causes transient increases in blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac index, although hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias and cardiac decompensation have also occurred. With anesthetic ketamine, systolic and diastolic pressure commonly peak 10–50% above baseline. Intranasal esketamine raises blood pressure at all recommended doses; 3–19% of treated patients versus 1–4% of placebo recipients had at least one rise of at least 40 mmHg systolic and/or 25 mmHg diastolic during the first four weeks.
  sourceId: spravato-label
- title: Neuropsychiatric, sedative and respiratory effects
  description: KETALAR emergence reactions occur in approximately 12% of patients and can include dream-like states, vivid imagery, hallucinations, confusion, agitation or delirium; psychiatric adverse events have also been reported to persist for days to weeks. SPRAVATO trials recorded sedation in 48–61% and loss of consciousness in 0.3–0.4%. Respiratory depression can occur with rapid or excessive ketamine exposure, and postmarketing esketamine reports include respiratory depression and rare respiratory arrest.
  sourceId: ketalar-label
- title: Urinary and hepatobiliary injury with recurrent exposure
  description: Long-term ketamine use or abuse has been associated with cystitis, reduced bladder capacity, ureteral stenosis or obstruction, hydronephrosis and renal impairment, and with cholestatic hepatobiliary dysfunction, biliary strictures and sclerosing cholangitis. SPRAVATO trials had more lower-urinary-tract symptoms than placebo but no esketamine-related interstitial cystitis in studies extending to one year.
  sourceId: ketalar-label
- title: Abuse, tolerance and dependence
  description: Ketamine and esketamine are Schedule III controlled substances in the United States. Prolonged ketamine exposure can produce tolerance and physical dependence. Withdrawal described after frequent, long-term high-dose exposure includes craving, fatigue, poor appetite and anxiety. Recurrent high-dose misuse or abuse may also be associated with memory or attention impairment.
  sourceId: ketalar-label
- title: Pregnancy and developmental uncertainty
  description: Human ketamine pregnancy data are concentrated around cesarean anesthesia and have not identified a drug-associated maternal or fetal risk, but the evidence is limited by small samples, retrospective collection and absent long-term follow-up; data for other stages of pregnancy are insufficient to estimate major malformation or miscarriage risk. Animal studies of ketamine or esketamine show developmental toxicity, and prolonged NMDA-blocking anesthetic exposure during fetal brain development causes neuronal apoptosis in primates; the clinical significance for humans remains uncertain.

  insight: A single 0.5 mg/kg IV racemic-ketamine infusion improved depression scores versus midazolam at 24 hours; the between-group advantage was not statistically significant at day 7, and transient dissociation and hemodynamic stopping events occurred.
  limitation: Selected treatment-resistant population, exclusion of psychotic and substance-use disorders, medication washout, one infusion, brief follow-up and recognizable psychoactive effects limit generalization and long-term inference.

  kind: Phase 4 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial
  pmid: "40601310"
  doi: 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.1317
  insight: Fixed-dose intranasal esketamine monotherapy at 56 or 84 mg twice weekly reduced MADRS scores versus placebo by day 28, with separation also present approximately 24 hours after the first dose.
  limitation: Significant psychiatric or medical comorbidity and substance dependence were excluded; racial and ethnic diversity was limited; adverse effects could reveal assignment, with 71.1% of the 56-mg group and 78.3% of the 84-mg group strongly believing they had received esketamine; the extension phase was uncontrolled.
  funding: Janssen Research & Development.

  kind: Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
  pmid: "30570761"
  doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD012033.pub4
  insight: Across 130 studies with 8341 participants, perioperative IV ketamine modestly reduced postoperative pain and opioid consumption; pooled CNS adverse events were not significantly different from control.
  limitation: Operations, regimens and study sizes were heterogeneous; many arms contained fewer than 50 participants, small-study effects affected certainty, and the primary pooled analysis was not stratified by dose.
  funding: Finnish state funding for university-level health research (TYH2014305), with additional financial support acknowledged from Helsinki University Hospital Research Funds.
  sponsorshipStatus: non-industry-funded
  conflictsOfInterest: Brinck, Tiippana, Heesen, Bell and Kontinen reported none known. Straube's institution had received an advisory-board fee from Daiichi Sankyo; Moore disclosed Grünenthal and Novartis grants and pharmaceutical-industry honoraria unrelated to this review.
