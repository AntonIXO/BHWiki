## Summary

Morphine is recorded as a canonical identity from a source-backed OptiHealth candidate. This draft does not assert effects, dosing, safety, or efficacy.

## Description

This page records the source-backed identity label Morphine. The import preserves the candidate's aliases and source trail only; molecular structure, pharmacokinetics, effects, dosing, safety, and efficacy remain unestablished here.

## Evidence note

PubMed abstracts for both linked morphine PMIDs were retrieved. They describe small randomized healthy-subject studies with acute oral doses; results are task-specific and do not support general cognitive-enhancement claims.


## Doses

```yaml
- label: Single-dose cognitive crossover
  amount: 10 or 15 mg morphine sulfate once
  quantity: 10
  quantityMax: 15
  unit: mg
  ingredient: Morphine sulfate
  formulation: Oral morphine sulfate
  route: oral
  frequency: single dose
  duration: acute; assessments to 6 hours
  population: 12 healthy subjects
  purpose: Cognitive and psychomotor effects
  sourceCategory: research
  note: Research exposure; not a safe self-experimentation dose.
  sourceId: reddit-pmid-8582463
- label: Repeated-dose cognitive crossover
  amount: 10 mg morphine sulfate every 4 hours for four doses
  quantity: 10
  quantityMax: 10
  unit: mg per dose
  ingredient: Morphine sulfate
  formulation: Oral morphine sulfate
  route: oral
  frequency: every 4 hours ×4
  duration: one study day
  population: 10 healthy subjects
  purpose: Repeated-dose cognition and psychomotor effects
  sourceCategory: research
  note: Controlled laboratory exposure; not a treatment recommendation.

## Pharmacokinetics

```yaml
- id: morphine-pk-unestablished
  analyte: Morphine
  route: oral
  formulation: Morphine sulfate
  population: Healthy-subject cognitive studies
  endpoint: elimination-half-life
  statistic: not-established
  value: null
  low: null
  high: null
  unit: hours
  context: The linked cognitive abstracts report timing of effects but no plasma PK parameter.

## Outcomes

```yaml
- id: morphine-alertness-8582463
  conceptId: alertness-response
  name: Psychomotor and subjective alertness
  direction: Variable
  evidence: Human research
  description: Morphine effects were less dramatic than lorazepam; critical-flicker threshold was reduced over 6 hours and subjective alertness changes were not significant.
  sourceId: reddit-pmid-8582463
  population: 12 healthy subjects
  exposure: 10 or 15 mg morphine sulfate once
  instrument: Critical flicker fusion and subjective ratings
  magnitude: CFFT reduction over observation period
  reportType: measured-assessment
- id: morphine-memory-8582463
  conceptId: episodic-memory
  name: Delayed memory recall
  direction: Decreased
  evidence: Human research
  description: Single 10 or 15 mg oral morphine doses impaired delayed word recall and picture-recognition sensitivity at 1 hour in 12 healthy subjects.
  sourceId: reddit-pmid-8582463
  population: 12 healthy subjects
  exposure: 10 or 15 mg morphine sulfate once
  instrument: Delayed word recall and picture recognition
  magnitude: Significant at 1 hour
  reportType: measured-assessment
- id: morphine-reaction-10692620
  conceptId: attention
  name: Choice reaction accuracy
  direction: Increased
  evidence: Human research
  description: Four 10 mg oral morphine doses at 4-hour intervals increased choice-reaction accuracy at every assessment in 10 healthy subjects; other effects were sporadic.
  sourceId: reddit-pmid-10692620
  population: 10 healthy subjects
  exposure: 10 mg every 4 hours ×4
  instrument: Choice reaction and vigilance tasks
  magnitude: Accuracy increase; no broad cognitive enhancement established
  reportType: measured-assessment

## Mechanisms

```yaml
[]
```

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Acute opioid cognitive impairment
  description: Single oral morphine doses impaired delayed memory and reduced critical-flicker threshold; repeated-dose findings
    do not establish safety outside controlled studies.
