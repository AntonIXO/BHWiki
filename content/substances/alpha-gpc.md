## Summary

Canonical topic: Alpha-GPC. Synonyms: L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine, L-alpha-GPC, alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine, choline alfoscerate. Formula C8H20NO6P; molecular weight 257.22 g/mol. It should remain a separate BHWiki entity from choline chloride, choline bitartrate, phosphatidylcholine/lecithin, citicoline/CDP-choline, and generic dietary choline; findings for those substances are not Alpha-GPC efficacy evidence.

## Description

Oral L-alpha-GPC is rapidly absorbed and raises plasma free choline, but a human parent-compound elimination half-life is not established. A 2003 placebo-controlled Alzheimer trial and a 2023 meta-analysis reported cognitive improvement, while a 2024 adjunct RCT had nonsignificant primary comparisons and healthy-person results remain endpoint-dependent.

## Evidence note

The evidence separates downstream plasma free-choline exposure from intact Alpha-GPC pharmacokinetics. Alzheimer and adjunct-treatment trials use 1,200 mg/day, while small healthy-person studies show mixed, endpoint-specific results. A large claims cohort reports an observational stroke association; causality and a parent-compound half-life remain unestablished.

## Mechanisms

```yaml
- title: Choline precursor pathway
  description: Human ADME evidence supports Alpha-GPC as an orally absorbed source of free choline and glycerophosphate, while choline is a precursor used in acetylcholine synthesis. This precursor relationship does not by itself establish increased brain acetylcholine after a given oral dose or a clinical cognitive benefit.
  sourceId: efsa-2026
  conceptId: choline-precursor
```

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Short-term tolerability
  description: Health Canada’s review of oral exposure up to 1,200 mg/day reported transient agitation, gastrointestinal symptoms, insomnia, nausea, headache, fever and hypotension in small studies; uncommon or delayed harm remains uncertain.
  sourceId: health-canada-2023
- title: Observational stroke signal
  description: A Korean claims cohort found higher incident total, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke among Alpha-GPC users after matching. The association is observational and vulnerable to residual confounding; it does not establish causality.
  sourceId: lee-stroke-2021
- title: Pregnancy and pediatric evidence gap
  description: Therapeutic-dose pregnancy, lactation and pediatric efficacy data were not identified. EFSA’s proposed 203.7 mg/day novel-food use level is a lower regulatory exposure and cannot be extrapolated to 1,200 mg/day trials.
  sourceId: efsa-2026
- title: Organ-impairment evidence gap
  description: No dedicated renal or hepatic impairment PK study or evidence-based dose adjustment was identified; healthy-volunteer tolerability does not establish safety in organ disease.

  kind: Official GRAS notice record
  insight: FDA recorded no questions regarding ChemiNutra's GRAS conclusion for specified conventional-food uses of L-alpha-GPC at levels of 10–100 mg.
  limitation: A no-questions GRAS response is not FDA drug approval and does not establish efficacy or safety of all Alpha-GPC doses, formulations or supplement uses.
  funding: Not assessed; ChemiNutra, Inc. was the GRAS notifier.

  title: Notice of Modification to the List of permitted supplemental ingredients to enable the use of L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine in supplemented foods
  authors: Health Canada
  year: 2023
  url: https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/public-involvement-partnerships/notice-modification-list-ingredients-l-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine-supplemented-foods.html
  kind: Official regulatory notice
  insight: Canada enabled L-alpha-GPC as a source of supplemental choline in supplemented foods, subject to existing choline maximum levels and labeling conditions.
  limitation: The authorization concerns supplemented-food use under choline conditions, not proof of cognitive or exercise efficacy and not an unrestricted product authorization.
  funding: Government regulatory document; clinical-study sponsorship was not assessed.

  title: L-Alpha-Glycerylphosphorylcholine
  authors: United States Pharmacopeia
  year: 2023
  url: https://doi.usp.org/USPNF/USPNF_M10375_05_01.html
  kind: Compendial dietary-supplement monograph
  insight: USP-NF defines material produced from enriched phosphatidylcholine soy lecithin and specifies 98.0–102.0% Alpha-GPC on an anhydrous basis.
  limitation: A compendial specification describes conforming material; it does not demonstrate that every commercial Alpha-GPC product meets USP-NF requirements.

  authors: European Commission
  year: 2024
  url: https://food.ec.europa.eu/food-safety/novel-food/consultation-process-novel-food-status_en
  kind: Official regulatory status record
  insight: The European Commission consultation-status page lists L-alpha-GPC as Novel food, published March 22, 2024.
  limitation: Novel-food classification is distinct from completion of the EU authorization process or inclusion in the Union list.

  title: Pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of Alpha-GPC formulations after a single oral dose in healthy Korean men
  authors: Min et al.
  year: 2019
  url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31040642/
  kind: Randomized crossover bioequivalence study
  insight: Compared film-coated and soft-gel Alpha-GPC using baseline-corrected plasma choline; the endpoint was downstream free choline rather than intact parent Alpha-GPC.
  limitation: Healthy male sample and downstream analyte do not establish parent-compound half-life or clinical efficacy.
  pmid: "31040642"

  year: 2021
  url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34207484/
  kind: Randomized placebo-controlled human study
  insight: Two weeks of 400 mg/day Alpha-GPC produced a subjective motivation signal without an anxiety difference.
  limitation: Small single-blind study and subjective endpoint; it does not establish objective cognitive enhancement.
  pmid: "34207484"

  year: 1991
  url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2071257/
  kind: Human pharmacodynamic challenge study
  insight: Alpha-GPC pretreatment attenuated scopolamine-induced memory impairment in a challenge model.
  limitation: Challenge-model result does not establish general healthy-person enhancement or routine anticholinergic coadministration safety.
