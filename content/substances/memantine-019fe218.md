## Summary

Memantine is recorded as a canonical identity from a source-backed OptiHealth candidate. This draft does not assert effects, dosing, safety, or efficacy.

## Description

This page records the source-backed identity label Memantine. The import preserves the candidate's aliases and source trail only; molecular structure, pharmacokinetics, effects, dosing, safety, and efficacy remain unestablished here.

## Evidence note

PubMed abstracts for the 10 linked PMIDs were retrieved. Full text was not linked for these citations; records retain human, animal, and in-vitro populations separately and avoid treating the uncontrolled bipolar study as a randomized efficacy result.
