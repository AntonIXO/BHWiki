## Summary

Kava is recorded as a canonical identity from a source-backed OptiHealth candidate. This draft does not assert effects, dosing, safety, or efficacy.

## Description

This page records the source-backed identity label Kava. The import preserves the candidate's aliases and source trail only; molecular structure, pharmacokinetics, effects, dosing, safety, and efficacy remain unestablished here.

## Evidence note

Identity only import: the cited sources support candidate identity provenance, not an evidence review. No biological relationship or clinical claim is asserted.

Reddit index corpus import (13 linked source records; 12 PubMed abstracts). Full-text methods, funding, and conflicts remain unassessed where the source record says so.

PubMed MCP abstract review: 12 linked PubMed identifiers were retrieved for this Reddit-index entry; structured fields below are limited to abstract-supported findings. PMC full text was used where rights-eligible and available; remaining methods, funding, and conflicts are unassessed.

PubMed MCP abstract review covered 12 PMID-linked records for this Reddit-index entry. Structured fields are limited to abstract-supported findings; PMC full text was retrieved where rights-eligible and available, with remaining methods, funding, and conflicts unassessed.

  kind: PubMed publication
  insight: 'RESULTS: The use of kava occurs among indigenous populations in the South Pacific and in northern Australia, while also being used throughout the western world as a herbal medicine. Animal studies show that kava lactones alter neuronal excitation through direct interactions with voltage-dependent ion channels, giving rise to kava''s muscle relaxant, anaesthetic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsive properties. Several isolated cases of psychotic and severe dystonic reactions following kava use suggest that kava also has psychoactive properties, yet there is no conclusive evidence that kava interferes with normal cognitive processes.  CONCLUSIONS: Kava is effective in the treatment of tension and anx'

  authors: Sheree Cairney, Alan R Clough, Paul Maruff, Alex Collie, Bart J Currie, Jon Currie
  year: 2003
  url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12589393/
  kind: PubMed publication
  insight: Kava is an extract from the Piper methysticum Forst. f. plant that has been consumed in the Pacific islands for millennia and more recently, among indigenous populations, in northern Australia and throughout the Western world as an herbal medicine. Through alterations on neuronal excitation, kava induces muscle relaxation, anasthesia, and has anxiolytic properties.
