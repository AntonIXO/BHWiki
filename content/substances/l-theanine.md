## Summary

A tea-derived amino acid studied alone and alongside caffeine. Small attention studies offer useful signals, with important limits.

## Description

L-theanine is often discussed as a partner to caffeine. Evidence for a particular combination should stay attached to that combination, task and population. Human absorption has been studied, but a tidy claim that it reliably cancels caffeine's adverse effects goes beyond the sources included here.

## Evidence note

Selected small human studies are included. Combination findings do not establish theanine-alone benefit.

Reddit index corpus import (13 linked source records; 11 PubMed abstracts). Full-text methods, funding, and conflicts remain unassessed where the source record says so.

PubMed MCP abstract review: 12 linked PubMed identifiers were retrieved for this Reddit-index entry; structured fields below are limited to abstract-supported findings. PMC full text was used where rights-eligible and available; remaining methods, funding, and conflicts are unassessed.

## Mechanisms

- title: Absorption is better established than a clinical mechanism
  description: The kinetic study detected theanine and its metabolites in people. It does not establish which molecule explains a cognitive effect.

## Cautions

- title: Combination evidence has limits
  description: This small, acute study cannot establish long-term benefit or show that theanine removes caffeine-related sleep disruption.

- title: Source-specific finding from PMID 26869148
  description: 'RESULTS: Mean RVRT was significantly improved by theanine (P = 0.019), caffeine (P = 0.043), and theanine-caffeine combination (P = 0.001), but not by tea (P = 0.429) or placebo (P = 0.822). VEP or MEP latencies or SVRT did not show significant inter-treatment differences. Theanine (P = 0.001) and caffeine (P = 0.001) elicited significantly larger mean peak-to-peak N2-P300 ERP amplitudes than the placebo, whereas theanine-caffeine combination elicited a significantly larger mean N2-P300 amplitude than placebo (P < 0.001), theanine (P = 0.029) or caffeine (P = 0.005).

  description: 'RESULTS: Caffeine reduced oxygenated haemoglobin (oxy-Hb), increased deoxygenated haemoglobin (deoxy-Hb), improved performance on attention tasks and increased overall mood ratings. Increases in deoxy-Hb following caffeine were more pronounced in non-consumers. Some evidence for increased deoxy-Hb remained when caffeine was combined with L-theanine, but this effect was attenuated and the effects of caffeine on oxy-Hb, cognition and mood were eradicated.  CONCLUSIONS: Combining L-theanine with caffeine, at levels and ratios equivalent to one to two cups of tea, eliminated the vasoconstrictive effect and behavioural effects of caffeine.
