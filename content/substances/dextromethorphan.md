## Summary

Dextromethorphan is a U.S. over-the-counter oral antitussive ingredient for temporary suppression of cough from minor throat or bronchial irritation. Human pharmacokinetic studies show unusually large exposure differences because CYP2D6 converts dextromethorphan to dextrorphan: poor metabolizers and CYP2D6 inhibition retain much more parent drug and form less dextrorphan. Controlled supratherapeutic dosing produces dose-related perceptual, dissociative/hallucinogen-like, autonomic and emetic effects. Clinical evidence for cough is endpoint-dependent rather than uniformly positive, and a randomized off-label pain trial was null. Serotonin toxicity has been reported with supratherapeutic dextromethorphan plus SSRIs, while chronic very-high-dose use has produced dependence and withdrawal in case reports. A controlled observational pregnancy study found no excess of major malformations, but its size cannot exclude uncommon risks.

## Description

The chemical identity here is parent dextromethorphan, C18H25NO; marketed cough products commonly use dextromethorphan hydrobromide and dose it in hydrobromide-equivalent milligrams. Dextrorphan is a distinct CYP2D6-generated metabolite and is not treated as interchangeable evidence. FDA OTC Monograph M012 lists dextromethorphan and dextromethorphan hydrobromide as oral antitussive active ingredients, while the current single-ingredient DailyMed softgel label describes temporary cough relief from minor throat and bronchial irritation associated with a cold.

The OTC cough indication is separated here from off-label and nonmedical claims. Analgesic efficacy was tested directly in a randomized medication-abortion study and was not demonstrated. Controlled high-dose findings establish altered perception and subjective state, not a therapeutic psychiatric indication. Combination-product evidence is not transferred to dextromethorphan monotherapy.

## Evidence note

Direct evidence includes small human CYP2D6 pharmacokinetic experiments, a randomized crossover cough study, a 12-participant controlled supratherapeutic study, a 156-participant randomized off-label pain trial, a 184-exposure pregnancy cohort, and clinical case reports. Experimental cough challenge, subjective cough burden, cough frequency, psychoactive ratings and pain are not pooled. Several older primary papers lack accessible PMC full text; funding and conflict fields therefore retain PubMed-level information or are marked not reported. Combination-product efficacy evidence was excluded.

## Mechanisms

```yaml
- title: CYP2D6 O-demethylation to dextrorphan
  description: Human pharmacokinetic studies directly show CYP2D6-dependent formation of dextrorphan. In poor metabolizers, parent dextromethorphan dominates plasma exposure and dextrorphan formation is much lower; quinidine phenocopies reduced CYP2D6 activity.
  sourceId: schadel1995
- title: NMDA-receptor channel antagonism
  description: In guinea-pig neocortical slices, dextrorphan at 1–250 micromolar and dextromethorphan at 100 micromolar blocked NMDA-linked epileptiform activity; intracellular experiments found blockade of NMDA-induced depolarization without altering intrinsic membrane properties. This is preclinical mechanism evidence, not a clinical efficacy result.
  sourceId: wong1988
  conceptId: nmda-receptor
- title: Sigma-1 receptor binding
  description: A comparative receptor-binding study reported sigma-1 Ki values of 205 nM for dextromethorphan and 144 nM for dextrorphan, while dextrorphan had greater affinity than dextromethorphan at PCP/NMDA-channel sites. The assay does not establish which target mediates therapeutic cough suppression or human subjective effects.

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Serotonin toxicity with serotonergic co-exposure
  description: Two published cases met a serotonin-syndrome diagnosis with very high measured dextromethorphan concentrations plus therapeutic SSRI concentrations. One case also had markedly elevated chlorpheniramine, so the case series cannot define a dextromethorphan-only threshold or incidence.
  sourceId: schwartz2008
- title: Abuse, dependence and withdrawal
  description: A case report documents six years of escalation to 1,800 mg/day with functional neglect and withdrawal including craving, diaphoresis, nausea, hypertension and tachycardia. A single case establishes possibility, not prevalence.
  sourceId: mutschler2010
- title: Supratherapeutic acute effects
  description: Controlled high-dose administration produced dose-related increases in blood pressure, heart rate and emesis alongside perceptual and behavioral effects. The sample was small and selected for prior hallucinogen experience.
  sourceId: reissig2012
- title: Pregnancy evidence is reassuring but limited
  description: The Motherisk cohort did not find a higher overall major-malformation rate, but 128 first-trimester exposures cannot exclude uncommon defects or dose-specific risks.
  sourceId: einarson2001
- title: Current OTC pregnancy and breastfeeding precaution
  description: The current single-ingredient U.S. OTC label includes a pregnancy/breastfeeding precaution rather than an assertion of established safety.

  kind: controlled-human-laboratory-study
  insight: Single doses of 100–800 mg/70 kg produced dose-related perceptual, subjective and physiological effects in 12 volunteers.
  limitation: Small selected sample with prior hallucinogen experience; supratherapeutic exposures cannot be generalized to labeled cough dosing.

  title: Dextromethorphan-induced serotonin syndrome.
  authors: Anna R Schwartz; Anthony F Pizon; Daniel E Brooks
  year: 2008
  url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19238739/
  kind: case-series
  insight: Two serotonin-syndrome cases had supratherapeutic measured dextromethorphan with therapeutic SSRI concentrations.
  limitation: Only two cases; one included high chlorpheniramine exposure, and case reports cannot estimate incidence or a threshold.

  kind: case-report
  insight: Documents long-term escalation to 1,800 mg/day, dependence and autonomic withdrawal during inpatient detoxification.
  limitation: Single severe case; does not provide prevalence or risk at therapeutic doses.

  year: 2001
  url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11171724/
  kind: controlled-observational-pregnancy-study
  insight: Among 184 exposed pregnancies, the study did not find a higher overall major-malformation rate than matched controls.
  limitation: Observational counseling-program cohort with modest sample size; insufficient for uncommon defect patterns or definitive no-risk conclusions.

  title: Impact of Pregnancy and Vitamin A Supplementation on CYP2D6 Activity.

  year: 2023
  url: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9931631/
  kind: prospective-randomized-pharmacokinetic-study
  insight: Forty-seven completers showed higher dextromethorphan metabolic ratios during pregnancy than postpartum; vitamin A had no effect.
  limitation: Included CYP2D6 activity scores 1–2 and used short-window metabolic ratios rather than full dextromethorphan half-life.

  year: 2023
  url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36332661/
  kind: randomized-controlled-trial
  insight: In 156 randomized participants, adjunctive dextromethorphan did not reduce worst pain or analgesic use; satisfaction was lower than placebo.
  limitation: Condition- and regimen-specific; nearly one quarter used no analgesia, and adherence to counseled analgesics varied.

  year: 1988
  url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2897648/
  kind: preclinical-mechanistic-study
  insight: Both parent drug and dextrorphan blocked NMDA-linked electrophysiologic responses in guinea-pig neocortical slices.
  limitation: In-vitro animal tissue at micromolar concentrations; does not establish human target occupancy or clinical benefit.

  year: 1999
  url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10064839/
  kind: preclinical-receptor-binding-study
  insight: Direct comparative binding measured sigma-1 affinity and lower dextromethorphan than dextrorphan affinity at PCP/NMDA-channel sites.
  limitation: Preclinical comparative binding and mouse behavior; cannot assign a human therapeutic mechanism.
