kinetics:
  onset: No formulation-independent subjective onset is established here.
  peak: No universal peak time is assigned because absorption is formulation- and meal-dependent.
  duration: No formulation-independent subjective-effect duration is established here.
  bioavailability: Immediate-release oral bioavailability is dose-dependent and decreases as dose rises; the Neurontin label reports approximately 60%, 47%, 34%, 33%, and 27% at 900, 1200, 2400, 3600, and 4800 mg/day, respectively, when given in three divided doses.
  metabolism: Gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized in humans and is eliminated by renal excretion as unchanged drug.

## Summary

Gabapentin is the parent compound represented by PubChem CID 3446. Current U.S. Neurontin labeling covers postherpetic neuralgia in adults and adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, in adults and children aged 3 years and older; the gastroretentive Gralise formulation is labeled for postherpetic neuralgia and is not substitutable with other gabapentin products because its pharmacokinetics differ. Parent gabapentin is not a current U.S.-labeled restless-legs-syndrome treatment, although small randomized trials have studied it in RLS. This record does not merge evidence for gabapentin enacarbil or pregabalin into parent-gabapentin outcomes. Sources: pubchem; neurontin-label-2026; gralise-label-2026; garcia-borreguero-2002; thorp-2001.

## Description

The clinically used active ingredient in the cited Neurontin and Gralise products is gabapentin itself rather than a gabapentin hydrochloride salt. Neurontin is available as immediate-release capsules, tablets, and oral solution, whereas Gralise is a once-daily gastroretentive tablet whose food-dependent absorption and delayed peak distinguish it from immediate-release products. Gabapentin absorption is capacity-limited: oral bioavailability falls as dose increases, and the Gralise label describes absorption from the proximal small bowel through a saturable L-amino transport system. Gabapentin is essentially unmetabolized and is excreted unchanged through the kidneys. The EMA Neurontin referral documents nationally authorized European uses and harmonization across Member States rather than a single centralized EU authorization.

## Evidence note

Evidence is indication-, population-, dose-, and formulation-specific. Established postherpetic-neuralgia trials of immediate-release gabapentin found analgesic benefit, while one 1800 mg/day extended-release trial missed its prespecified primary endpoint; a separate randomized trial found no benefit when gabapentin was started during acute herpes zoster to prevent later PHN. Adjunctive focal-seizure trials show active treatment effects but include dose- and endpoint-specific null results. Parent-gabapentin RLS evidence comes mainly from small crossover trials, including a hemodialysis study; the later DISCO-RLS registry record is complete but has no posted results. Patient anxiety studies are conflicting—a social-phobia trial was positive while the overall panic-disorder analysis was null—and they do not establish healthy-person anxiolysis. A healthy-volunteer 250 mg study found little next-day cognitive/driving impairment on most measures but failed noninferiority on lane excursions, which is evidence against a broad cognitive-enhancement claim rather than evidence for one. The Wiffen systematic review was used as an evidence locator, but its pooled literature includes gabapentin enacarbil in addition to parent gabapentin, so its pooled estimates are not imported here as parent-only effects.

## Modifiers

```yaml
- label: Renal impairment
  effect: Elimination slows substantially as creatinine clearance declines
  detail: Gabapentin is excreted unchanged by the kidney; in the label single-dose renal study, mean half-life increased to about 52 hours when creatinine clearance was below 30 mL/min.
  sourceId: neurontin-label-2026
  observationId: gabapentin-severe-renal-impairment
  factorType: other
  direction: slower
- label: Hemodialysis
  effect: Hemodialysis substantially accelerates gabapentin removal in anuric patients
  detail: Apparent half-life was about 132 hours during a nondialysis period and about 3.8 hours during dialysis in the label study, which is why post-dialysis supplementation is specified for immediate-release gabapentin.
  sourceId: neurontin-label-2026
  observationId: gabapentin-anuric-during-dialysis
  factorType: other
  direction: faster
- label: Age
  effect: Apparent clearance decreases with increasing age, predominantly through declining renal function
  detail: The label reports apparent oral clearance falling from about 225 mL/min below age 30 to about 125 mL/min above age 70; elderly dosing therefore follows creatinine clearance rather than age alone.
  sourceId: neurontin-label-2026

## Mechanisms

```yaml
- title: α2δ calcium-channel-subunit binding
  description: Gabapentin binds with high affinity to the α2δ subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels in vitro. The current Neurontin label explicitly states that the relationship between this binding and gabapentin's antiepileptic or analgesic clinical effects is unknown; the binding observation therefore is not treated as proof of a clinical efficacy mechanism.
  sourceId: neurontin-label-2026
  conceptId: alpha2delta-vgcc
```

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, and impaired driving
  description: Controlled trials found increased somnolence and dizziness with gabapentin; in adjunctive epilepsy trials at doses up to 1800 mg/day, ataxia was reported in 13% versus 6% with placebo. The label warns that a patient's ability to drive or operate complex machinery should not be presumed unimpaired solely from self-assessment.
  sourceId: neurontin-label-2026
- title: Suicidal thoughts and behavior warning
  description: The antiepileptic-drug class warning is based on pooled placebo-controlled trials of 11 antiepileptic drugs, not a gabapentin-only estimate. The label reports an adjusted relative risk of 1.8 (95% CI 1.2–2.7), with suicidal behavior or ideation in 0.43% of antiepileptic-drug recipients versus 0.24% of placebo recipients, approximately one additional case per 530 treated patients.
  sourceId: neurontin-label-2026
- title: Respiratory depression
  description: Serious, life-threatening, and fatal respiratory depression has been reported when gabapentin is used with CNS depressants including opioids and in patients with underlying respiratory impairment. The label advises low-dose initiation where appropriate and monitoring for sedation and respiratory depression.
  sourceId: neurontin-label-2026
- title: Abrupt discontinuation and withdrawal
  description: Abrupt or rapid discontinuation can increase seizure risk and can produce withdrawal reactions. The Neurontin label recommends tapering over at least one week unless safety considerations require faster withdrawal; postmarketing withdrawal symptoms have often appeared within 48 hours after discontinuation.
  sourceId: neurontin-label-2026
- title: Misuse, abuse, dependence, and tolerance
  description: Postmarketing reports and published literature describe gabapentin misuse and abuse, particularly in people with polysubstance-use histories and sometimes at supratherapeutic or off-label doses. Dependence and withdrawal have also been reported. The MHRA strengthened gabapentinoid warnings in 2026 to emphasize addiction, dependence, withdrawal reactions, and tolerance.
  sourceId: mhra-2026
- title: Renal accumulation
  description: Because gabapentin is eliminated unchanged through the kidneys, impaired renal function can markedly prolong exposure. Dose adjustment is required for reduced creatinine clearance, and immediate-release Neurontin has specific post-hemodialysis supplemental dosing.
  sourceId: neurontin-label-2026
- title: Serious hypersensitivity reactions
  description: The Neurontin label warns about DRESS or multiorgan hypersensitivity as well as anaphylaxis and angioedema; these reactions can occur without the full classic constellation of rash, fever, or lymphadenopathy.
  sourceId: neurontin-label-2026

  year: 2010
  pmid: "20818838"
  doi: 10.2165/11539520-000000000-00000
  url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20818838/
  kind: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial
  insight: A 407-participant trial of 1800 mg/day extended-release gabapentin whose prespecified BOCF primary pain endpoint was null for both once-daily and divided dosing.
  limitation: Some secondary LOCF endpoints favored once-daily treatment despite the primary null result; those secondary analyses should not replace the prespecified primary conclusion.
  funding: Depomed, Inc. funded the study, designed it, directed data analysis, and participated with investigators and Solvay in data collection, interpretation, manuscript preparation, and publication decisions.
  sponsorshipStatus: industry-funded
  conflictsOfInterest: Wallace reported research support from Depomed; Irving reported Depomed advisory-board and speakers-bureau relationships among other industry relationships; Cowles was a Depomed employee who owned stock and options.

  doi: 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2012.07.011
  url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23149085/
  kind: Integrated analysis of two randomized phase-3 trials
  insight: Integrated 721-participant analysis found greater week-10 pain reduction and responder rates with gastroretentive gabapentin 1800 mg once daily than placebo.
  limitation: This is an integrated analysis of two component trials rather than an entirely independent cohort; cross-publication cohort overlap must not be double-counted.
  funding: The study was supported by Depomed, Inc.
  sponsorshipStatus: industry-funded
  conflictsOfInterest: Sweeney was a Depomed employee with stock and options; Vanhove was a former Depomed employee; Rauck and Wallace served as Depomed consultants, Rauck as a speaker, and Irving reported Depomed advisory-board and speakers-bureau compensation as well as other industry relationships.

  url: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6550400/
  kind: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial
  insight: Gabapentin begun within 72 hours of acute shingles did not prevent pain at week 12; the reported completer OR for any pain was 2.59 with a wide 95% CI of 0.59–11.28.
  limitation: Recruitment fell below the initially estimated sample size; attrition was greater with gabapentin, only a minority reached 1800 mg/day, and the prevention question is distinct from treatment of established PHN.

  kind: Randomized double-blind placebo- and active-controlled crossover trial
  insight: In 59 healthy volunteers, 250 mg gabapentin showed little appreciable next-day impairment on most driving and cognitive measures but failed noninferiority on lane excursions.
  limitation: Single low dose with testing 6.5 hours later; this cannot establish cognitive enhancement, absence of impairment at higher doses, chronic effects, or anxiolysis.
