## Summary

Cocaine is the parent tropane alkaloid represented here by PubChem CID 446220. Cocaine free base is the unprotonated parent compound; cocaine hydrochloride is its hydrochloride salt. The current U.S. NUMBRINO label uses an aqueous cocaine-hydrochloride solution and states that 40 mg cocaine hydrochloride is equivalent to 35.7 mg cocaine free base. Cocaine hydrochloride has a legitimate clinical role as a topical local anesthetic for procedures involving accessible nasal mucosa, while cocaine's rapid central stimulant effects, cardiovascular stress, and reinforcing properties underlie substantial nonmedical-use risk. These statements resolve to `pubchem`, `numbrino-label`, `volkow1997`, and `mittleman1999`.

Human laboratory evidence shows strong route dependence: smoking produces much faster absorption than intranasal administration, oral exposure is slower and less bioavailable than intravenous exposure, and faster delivery is associated with prominent reinforcing subjective effects. Acute epidemiologic studies associate recent cocaine exposure with myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, whereas the cited stroke study found no association for lifetime-ever use considered without acute timing. (`jeffcoat1989`, `coe2018`, `smith2001`, `mittleman1999`, `cheng2016`)

## Description

Cocaine has two clinically important chemical presentations. The free base is the neutral parent molecule; cocaine hydrochloride is a water-soluble salt used in the cited prescription nasal solution. The salt and free-base masses are therefore not interchangeable milligram-for-milligram. (`pubchem`, `numbrino-label`)

Its pharmacology combines monoamine-transporter inhibition with local-anesthetic sodium-channel blockade. Human PET work directly links striatal dopamine-transporter occupancy to the subjective cocaine “high,” while the prescription label attributes local anesthesia to reversible blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. (`volkow1997`, `numbrino-label`)

## Evidence note

Evidence is heterogeneous and route-specific. Controlled human studies are generally small and frequently enrolled experienced cocaine users rather than cocaine-naive populations; observational cardiovascular, neurologic, psychiatric, pregnancy, and withdrawal findings cannot eliminate all confounding. The current prescription label provides the strongest evidence for approved topical nasal use but does not establish safety for nonmedical routes or repeated exposure.

For `jeffcoat1989`, `smith2001`, `foltin2004`, `mittleman1999`, `majlesi2010`, `coffey2000`, `farre1997`, and `bandstra2001`, the evidence summarized here is limited to the retrieved PubMed abstract/indexing record where full publication text was not available in the retrieved primary-source record. Funding and conflicts are therefore reported only when directly available or indexed, and otherwise remain not reported. Study exposures below describe research or approved-label conditions, not a general safe-dose range.

## Mechanisms

```yaml
- title: Dopamine-transporter blockade
  description: PET imaging in regular cocaine users found that IV cocaine 0.3–0.6 mg/kg occupied about 60–77% of dopamine-transporter sites; self-reported high correlated with transporter occupancy, linking DAT blockade to acute subjective effects in humans.
  sourceId: volkow1997
  conceptId: dopamine-transporter
- title: Voltage-gated sodium-channel blockade
  description: The U.S. cocaine-hydrochloride label describes reversible blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels, preventing transient sodium conductance and action-potential propagation; this accounts for topical local anesthesia.
  sourceId: numbrino-label
```

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Cardiovascular toxicity
  description: Cocaine raises heart rate and blood pressure and can produce myocardial ischemia, infarction, and arrhythmias. The label warns that serious cardiovascular reactions have occurred, while the case-crossover study found a large but imprecise transient increase in MI-onset risk after recent use.
  sourceId: mittleman1999
- title: Neurologic toxicity
  description: Seizures are a recognized cocaine complication. A 43-patient multicenter retrospective series found most identified cocaine-associated seizures were single self-limited tonic-clonic events, but status epilepticus occurred in one patient.
  sourceId: majlesi2010
- title: Psychiatric and dependence risk
  description: The current prescription label carries a boxed warning for abuse and dependence and describes euphoria, excitation, anxiety, irritability, paranoia, confusion, and psychosis among effects associated with abuse; repeated misuse can produce physical dependence.
  sourceId: numbrino-label
- title: Abstinence and withdrawal uncertainty
  description: Prospective 28-day monitoring of 24 cocaine-dependent outpatients found improving negative affect and low craving without a clear phasic withdrawal syndrome or sleep disturbance, showing that withdrawal trajectories are not uniformly stereotyped.
  sourceId: coffey2000
- title: Pregnancy
  description: The prescription label states that data from a single medically applied topical dose are insufficient to determine pregnancy risk. Observational chronic-exposure literature is confounded by coexposures; a prospective cohort nevertheless found an adjusted fetal-growth association, while finding no disproportionate head-circumference deficit after overall growth was modeled.
  sourceId: bandstra2001
- title: Evidence does not define a nonmedical safe dose
  description: Human laboratory studies used screened participants, controlled formulations, monitoring, and predefined cardiovascular stopping criteria; their administered doses do not establish safety for unregulated formulations, repeated binges, or polysubstance exposure.
  sourceId: coe2018

  kind: Double-blind within-subject human laboratory study
  insight: Shows dose-dependent cardiovascular, subjective, and reinforcing effects after oral and IV cocaine and approximately tenfold greater IV potency across measured outcomes.
  limitation: Volunteers had histories of cocaine abuse; the retrieved abstract does not provide the sample size or complete adverse-event data.

  url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15159138/
  kind: Human repeated-dose laboratory study
  insight: Demonstrates dose-related positive subjective and cardiovascular effects and acute within-session tolerance despite approximately doubled plasma cocaine after the second dose.
  limitation: Ten experienced male users; short monitored sessions cannot characterize longer-term tolerance or heterogeneous populations.

  doi: 10.1038/386827a0

  kind: Human PET pharmacology study
  insight: Links IV cocaine dose, dopamine-transporter occupancy, striatal cocaine kinetics, and self-reported high.
  limitation: Controlled acute imaging study in regular cocaine users; it does not establish all molecular pathways responsible for reinforcement or dependence.

  kind: Case-crossover observational study
  insight: Estimates a sharp transient rise in myocardial-infarction onset during the hour after cocaine exposure.
  limitation: Only nine participants reported cocaine use in the hour before MI, yielding a wide confidence interval; exposure was retrospectively self-reported.

  kind: Population-based case-control study
  insight: Finds a strong association for use within 24 hours but no association for ever use; route-specific estimates have wide confidence intervals.
  limitation: Acute exposure was uncommon, self-reported, and observational; smoking- and inhalation-route estimates were imprecise.

  kind: Multicenter retrospective observational study
  insight: Describes 43 cocaine-associated seizure presentations, most of which were single tonic-clonic seizures.
  limitation: Retrospective attribution based on use history or urine testing; no denominator of all cocaine exposures, so absolute seizure incidence cannot be estimated.

  kind: Prospective abstinence study
  insight: Reports improving negative affect and cognition over 28 days, low craving, and no observed phasic withdrawal syndrome or sleep disturbance.
  limitation: Twenty-four outpatients; abstinence was inferred from urine testing and self-report, and the small sample may miss less common or heterogeneous withdrawal patterns.

  kind: Prospective pregnancy cohort
  insight: Reports adjusted cocaine-associated fetal-growth and gestational-age effects while finding no disproportionate head-circumference effect after overall growth was modeled.
  limitation: Restricted to full-term infants of African-American inner-city mothers; residual confounding and coexposures remain possible, and findings concern prenatal exposure patterns rather than a single medical topical dose.
