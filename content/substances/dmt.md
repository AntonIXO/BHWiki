  observationId: dmt-pk-good2023
kinetics:
  onset: IV bolus effects begin within seconds and peak within about 2 min; slower infusions produce a more gradual rise.
  peak: With IV bolus dosing, subjective effects peak within the first 2 min. With the 10-min SPL026 infusion, plasma Tmax was near the end of infusion, approximately 10–12 min.
  duration: Felt effects after IV bolus are much longer than the plasma half-life but still brief, generally subsiding within about 12–30 min in a modern controlled bolus study. Continuous infusion can sustain effects while drug delivery continues.
  bioavailability: The human evidence emphasized here uses intravenous DMT. DMT without monoamine-oxidase inhibition has poor oral availability because of rapid metabolism; ayahuasca or pharmaceutical DMT-plus-MAO-inhibitor regimens are pharmacologically different interventions.
  metabolism: DMT is rapidly cleared, with human in-vitro and clinical evidence supporting a major role for MAO-A and rapid formation of indole-3-acetic acid. CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C19 metabolized DMT in vitro where MAO-A activity was sparse.

## Summary

N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a tryptamine psychedelic whose human intravenous pharmacology is characterized by extremely rapid onset, intense dose-dependent alterations of perception and consciousness, and rapid plasma clearance. Modern fixed-dose, bolus, and continuous-infusion studies show that the administration pattern strongly changes both the time course and tolerability of the experience: an IV bolus can peak within about 2 min and resolve within roughly 12–30 min, whereas controlled infusion can sustain a chosen intensity for hours while drug delivery continues. Plasma half-life estimates are correspondingly short, approximately 9–12 min after a 10-min infusion and about 6–7 min in a recent bolus study. Sources: `strassman1994-subjective`, `good2023-pk`, `erne2025-continuous`, `erne2026-bolus`.

Human evidence is strongest for acute pharmacology and safety under intensive research supervision, not for established clinical treatment. A 2026 phase IIa trial in 34 adults with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder found a greater 2-week reduction in MADRS depression scores after one 21.5 mg, 10-min IV DMT session with psychotherapeutic support than after placebo, but the study was small, industry-sponsored, and incorporated substantial psychological support; longer follow-up after the blinded comparison included open-label treatment and therefore cannot by itself establish durable placebo-controlled efficacy. Source: `erritzoe2026-mdd`.

DMT should not be conflated with ayahuasca, 5-MeO-DMT, psilocybin, or isolated harmala alkaloids. In particular, ayahuasca changes DMT pharmacokinetics by combining DMT with monoamine-oxidase-A inhibition and is therefore not evidence for DMT monotherapy. Source: `good2023-pk`.

## Description

DMT is N,N-dimethyltryptamine, PubChem CID 6089, molecular formula C12H16N2 and molecular weight 188.27 g/mol. This article concerns DMT itself and prioritizes controlled human IV bolus and infusion data. Source: `pubchem6089`.

Classic human dose-response work found an almost immediate subjective response after IV administration, with higher doses producing vivid visual phenomena, profound changes in bodily awareness and sense of self, euphoria in some sessions, and anxiety or loss of control in others. Contemporary studies reproduce the steep, rapid dose-response while showing that slower or participant-adjustable infusion can soften the transition into the psychedelic state. Sources: `strassman1994-subjective`, `james2024-phase1`, `erne2025-continuous`, `erne2026-bolus`.

The acute physiological state is not purely subjective. Human studies have measured transient increases in blood pressure, autonomic changes, pupil dilation, altered sustained attention and postural stability, and suppression of occipital alpha EEG power at sufficient exposure. These outcomes need to be distinguished from subjective intensity and from pharmacokinetics: plasma DMT can have a single-digit-minute elimination half-life even though conscious effects persist longer, while continuous drug delivery can maintain effects despite rapid clearance. Sources: `strassman1994-autonomic`, `james2024-phase1`, `vanderheijden2025-sixhour`, `erne2026-bolus`.

## Evidence note

The evidence base contains several small controlled human studies with unusually detailed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic sampling, but sample sizes remain modest and study populations are heavily screened. Psychedelic-naïve and psychedelic-experienced volunteers have both been studied; protocols differ in blinding, preparation, room environment, psychological support, infusion rate, bolus use, and expectancy, all of which complicate cross-study dose comparisons. Sources: `good2023-pk`, `james2024-phase1`, `erne2025-continuous`, `erne2026-bolus`.

The most direct DMT-only randomized clinical efficacy evidence located for major depression is the 2026 SPL026 phase IIa study. A recruiting Swiss study is separately examining antidepressant response to DMT with versus without propofol masking; its registry entry has no efficacy results and is not evidence that the intervention works. Sources: `erritzoe2026-mdd`, `nct06927076`.

Human receptor evidence should be described conservatively. The reviewed literature includes analyses that relate DMT-induced fMRI reorganization to independently acquired PET maps of neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, including the serotonin system, but this is not the same as directly measuring DMT receptor occupancy with PET in the dosed participants. No direct human DMT 5-HT2A occupancy study was identified in the evidence set reviewed for this article; that is a search-limited evidence gap, not proof that none exists.

## Modifiers

```yaml
- label: Cigarette smoking
  effect: Higher DMT plasma concentrations at similar infusion rates
  detail: In a 2026 IV study, plasma concentrations in healthy smokers were roughly twice those in non-smokers at similar infusion rates. The authors proposed exposure to MAO-A-inhibiting compounds in cigarette smoke as a likely explanation; this was an interpretation rather than a randomized smoking intervention.
  sourceId: vanderheijden2026-smoking
  observationId: dmt-pk-smoking2026
  factorType: smoking
  direction: slower
- label: Blinding, expectancy, and dose-escalation context
  effect: Subjective intensity and tolerability varied with administration context
  detail: In the 2026 bolus program, participants in a separate open-label stepwise dose-escalation arm rated equivalent dose levels as less intense and tolerated them better than participants in the blinded randomized arm. Because assignment to these study arms was not itself randomized, expectancy and selection effects cannot be separated cleanly.
  sourceId: erne2026-bolus
  observationId: dmt-pk-expectancy2026
  factorType: other
  direction: variable
- label: Continuous exposure
  effect: Moderate acute tolerance to some subjective effects
  detail: During 120-min continuous infusions, some acute subjective responses diminished despite ongoing exposure, consistent with moderate acute tolerance. A separate repeated-bolus study did not detect acute tolerance, so the phenomenon appears protocol-dependent rather than universal.
  sourceId: erne2025-continuous
  observationId: dmt-pk-continuous-tolerance2025
  factorType: other
  direction: variable
- label: Body weight and BMI
  effect: No detected relationship with peak exposure in the inspected fixed-dose infusion study
  detail: Post-hoc analyses in the SPL026 phase I study did not find body weight or BMI to predict dose-normalized peak DMT exposure. The study was small and does not establish that body composition can never contribute to variability.
  sourceId: good2023-pk
  observationId: dmt-pk-body-size2023
  factorType: other
  direction: variable
- label: Research setting
  effect: Psychedelic experience may depend on environmental and interpersonal context
  detail: SPL026 phase I participants underwent preparation and were dosed in a purpose-designed room with soft lighting, furnishings, music, nature imagery, an eye mask, and therapist/psychiatrist presence. The 6-h study explicitly noted that its researcher interaction and computerized testing environment differed from eyes-closed psychedelic protocols and could have influenced subjective effects.

## Mechanisms

```yaml
- title: Rapid MAO-A-mediated metabolism
  description: Human pharmacokinetic and in-vitro experiments support rapid oxidative metabolism of DMT through MAO-A, with indole-3-acetic acid as an important downstream metabolite. Inhibition of MAO-A markedly reduced DMT clearance in experimental systems; CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 also metabolized DMT in vitro but are unlikely to explain the exceptionally high systemic clearance of IV DMT by themselves.
  sourceId: good2023-pk
- title: Serotonergic receptor-system association
  description: Human neuroimaging analyses have related regional DMT-induced functional-connectivity changes to independently acquired PET maps of neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, including serotonin-receptor distributions. This provides spatial association evidence, not direct measurement of DMT receptor occupancy in the participants receiving DMT.
  sourceId: luppi2023-pet-atlas
  conceptId: serotonin-2a
- title: 5-HT2A-linked large-scale brain dynamics
  description: A time-dependent whole-brain model fitted to fMRI data from 15 volunteers given 20 mg IV DMT found transient increases in modeled brain reactivity concentrated in frontoparietal and visual regions and correlated with 5-HT2A receptor-density maps. The receptor link is correlational/model-based and should not be read as a direct PET occupancy result.
  sourceId: piccinini2025-dynamics
  conceptId: serotonin-2a
- title: 5-HT1A modulation of the DMT experience
  description: In 12 experienced participants, pretreatment with 30 mg oral pindolol before 0.1 mg/kg IV DMT increased Hallucinogen Rating Scale effects and increased blood pressure and mean arterial pressure at 2 min without significantly changing heart rate. This suggests that 5-HT1A signaling modulates, rather than simply generates, the human DMT subjective response.
  sourceId: zahid2026-pindolol
  conceptId: 5-ht1a
```

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Acute cardiovascular load
  description: Controlled IV DMT can transiently increase blood pressure, and classic bolus work also found dose-related autonomic and cardiovascular activation. Modern trials generally screened out clinically important baseline cardiovascular abnormalities. The available healthy-volunteer safety findings therefore should not be generalized to uncontrolled use or to people with significant cardiovascular disease.
  sourceId: james2024-phase1
- title: Anxiety, panic, and prolonged psychological reactions
  description: Most adverse events in modern supervised studies were mild or moderate, but clinically important anxiety can occur. In the 6-h study one participant required counseling after a moderate anxiety event and the report described a prolonged anxiety course; the 2026 bolus program also described a participant who developed post-session anxiety/panic requiring subsequent care. Small screened trials cannot quantify the population incidence of rare or persistent psychiatric adverse reactions.
  sourceId: vanderheijden2025-sixhour
- title: Psychiatric screening limits generalizability
  description: Several healthy-volunteer programs excluded current or past psychiatric disorders, suicidality, or close family history of psychotic or bipolar disorders. These exclusions reduce direct evidence for safety in people at elevated risk of mania or psychosis. The separate MDD trial establishes that depression itself is not universally excluded, but it used clinical screening and supervised psychological support.
  sourceId: good2023-pk
- title: Pregnancy and lactation evidence gap
  description: Pregnancy and lactation were exclusion criteria in the SPL026 clinical program. The trial therefore does not establish pregnancy safety, and absence of pregnancy participants must not be interpreted as evidence of safety or evidence of teratogenic harm.
  sourceId: nct04673383
- title: Monoamine-oxidase inhibition can fundamentally alter DMT exposure
  description: DMT is rapidly metabolized by MAO-A. Combining DMT with MAO-A inhibition, as occurs pharmacologically in ayahuasca-type preparations or synthetic DMT-plus-MAO-inhibitor regimens, changes bioavailability and duration and should not be treated as equivalent to DMT monotherapy. The IV DMT studies summarized here generally do not establish the safety of combining their regimens with MAO inhibitors.
  sourceId: good2023-pk
- title: Evidence comes from controlled settings
  description: Preparation, close observation, trained staff, controlled rooms, and in some protocols continuous cardiovascular or neurophysiological assessment were integral to the research context. Safety findings from those environments do not establish equivalent risk under unsupervised conditions.
  sourceId: good2023-pk

  otherSlug: null
  summary: MAO-A is a major route of DMT metabolism. Inhibiting MAO-A can substantially change DMT exposure and can make oral DMT pharmacologically active in combination preparations. Ayahuasca is therefore an MAOI-containing comparator/context and must not be treated as DMT monotherapy.
  sourceId: good2023-pk
  mechanism: Reduced MAO-A-mediated oxidative deamination of DMT.

  year: 2026
  url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/42068196/
  kind: Primary randomized double-blind placebo-controlled human interaction study
  insight: In 12 experienced participants, 30 mg oral pindolol pretreatment increased the subjective response to 0.1 mg/kg IV DMT and increased blood pressure and mean arterial pressure at 2 min without a significant heart-rate effect.
  limitation: Very small sample, sub-hallucinogenic DMT dose, and a pharmacological interaction design that does not directly quantify receptor occupancy. Full-text funding and conflict declarations were not inspected for this review.
