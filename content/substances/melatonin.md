## Summary

Melatonin is a circadian timing signal. Strategically timed low-dose immediate-release melatonin can help selected delayed sleep-wake phase disorder and jet-lag patients, while prolonged-release products have formulation-specific evidence in older adults and neurodevelopmental populations. It is not a universal insomnia or cognitive-enhancement drug. [sletten2018]

## Description

Human evidence depends on formulation, clock time, light exposure, population and endpoint. Biomarker phase shifts and plasma exposure are distinct from sleep, daytime function and patient-important outcomes. [harpsoe2015]

## Evidence note

Evidence is strongest for selected circadian disorders and specific prolonged-release products; evidence for general adult chronic insomnia, antidepressant effects, cognition, analgesia and long-term high-dose safety remains limited or inconsistent. [dr-melatonin-s17]

## Mechanisms

```yaml
- title: Circadian signal
  description: Melatonin acts as a darkness-associated timing signal; receptor pharmacology does not substitute for appropriately timed light and sleep scheduling.
  sourceId: harpsoe2015
```

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Next-day impairment
  description: Drowsiness, headache and dizziness occur in short trials; higher-dose studies found increased overall adverse effects, and product labels warn against driving until recovered.
  sourceId: dr-melatonin-s41
- title: Pregnancy and lactation
  description: Human safety evidence is inadequate; current product information advises avoidance or individualized decisions rather than a universal safety claim.
  sourceId: dr-melatonin-s59
- title: Product-content variability
  description: Analyses of commercial supplements found substantial label discordance and occasional serotonin contamination; pharmaceutical trial doses should not be assumed equivalent to arbitrary gummies or powders.
  sourceId: nccih-melatonin
- title: Shift-work recommendations are conditional and safety-sensitive
  description: The 2026 American Academy of Sleep Medicine guideline conditionally suggests melatonin for daytime sleep disturbance or naps after night shifts, while warning that temporary sleepiness and reduced cognitive performance can increase driving or workplace risk until resolved.
