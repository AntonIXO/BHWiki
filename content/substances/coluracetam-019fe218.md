## Summary

Coluracetam is represented here by preclinical MKC-231 studies. In AF64A-lesioned mice, repeated oral MKC-231 improved working-memory deficits and partly restored hippocampal acetylcholine; acute dosing was inactive. No human efficacy or clinical dose is established. [PMID 7710736](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7710736/) [PMID 17467960](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17467960/)

## Description

The Reddit index links three MKC-231 publications. They test mice, rats, or cultured rat neurons, so the findings should not be generalized to healthy human cognition. MKC-231 is the compound identified in those papers; coluracetam equivalence is retained as the index label.

## Evidence note

Reviewed three PubMed abstracts. No linked article had PMC full text available through the connector. Doses and outcomes below are limited to what the abstracts report.

## Mechanisms

```yaml
- title: Choline uptake and acetylcholine release
  description: MKC-231 is described as a high-affinity choline-uptake enhancer; chronic treatment reversed AF64A-associated hippocampal acetylcholine depletion.
  sourceId: reddit-pmid-7710736
- title: Calcium-linked neuroprotection
  description: In cultured cortical neurons, MKC-231 reduced glutamate and ionomycin cytotoxicity but not S-nitrosocysteine toxicity, consistent with suppression of NO formation triggered by Ca2+ influx.
  sourceId: reddit-pmid-9541286
- title: Septal cholinergic preservation
  description: In PCP-exposed rats, MKC-231 antagonized the reduction in medial-septum choline-acetyltransferase-positive cells but not the ventrostriatal dynorphin-A change.
  sourceId: reddit-pmid-17467960
```

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Preclinical evidence only
  description: The linked studies used mice, rats, or cultured rat neurons; no human dosing, pharmacokinetics, or clinical safety evidence is established here.
  sourceId: reddit-index-coluracetam-019fe218
- title: Acute and chronic findings differ
  description: Acute MKC-231 did not improve AF64A memory deficits in the mouse study, whereas 11-day treatment did; the chronic result should not be presented as an immediate effect.
  sourceId: reddit-pmid-7710736
