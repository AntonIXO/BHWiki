## Summary

Galantamine inhibits acetylcholinesterase and influences nicotinic receptor signalling. Studies explore memory and attention.

## Description

Galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with acute human studies showing task-specific changes in memory and attention and measurable AChE inhibition, but no general cognitive enhancement in healthy adults.

## Evidence note

Study findings and methods are linked to their original publications.

## Mechanisms

```yaml
- title: Acetylcholinesterase inhibition
  description: Galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. In healthy adults, single 4 or 8 mg doses inhibited circulating AChE but not BChE; the investigators inferred that central acetylcholine levels were likely increased.
  sourceId: pubmed-25455867
- title: Cholinergic modulation of attention and memory
  description: Galantamine challenge altered alpha oscillations during working memory and increased the modeled rate of Bayesian belief updating about spatial-cue validity, linking cholinergic stimulation to task-specific network effects.
  sourceId: pubmed-27222217
```

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: No general cognitive-enhancement signal in healthy adults
  description: Galantamine slowed working-memory retrieval and impaired familiarity recognition in one study; another found no neurobehavioral improvement despite AChE inhibition, so these findings do not support use as a general enhancer in healthy people.
  sourceId: pubmed-27222217
- title: Cholinesterase inhibition without established benefit
  description: Single 4 or 8 mg doses inhibited circulating AChE but not BChE in healthy adults; the abstract reports no neurobehavioral improvement for galantamine and notes possible ceiling effects.
  sourceId: pubmed-25455867
- title: Dose and population limitations
  description: The research-linked studies were acute experiments in healthy adults; dose, formulation, and longer-term tolerability cannot be generalized beyond the tested protocols.
  sourceId: pubmed-25411501
