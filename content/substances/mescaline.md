## Summary

Mescaline, PubChem CID 4076. Across oral mescaline hydrochloride doses of 100 to 800 mg, a population model estimated a 3.5-hour half-life.

## Description

Two phase I trials contributed 105 single-dose administrations in 49 participants. The model was one-compartment, with first-order absorption and elimination and a lag time. Total exposure and Cmax were dose-proportional. Effect intensity and duration figures below are model predictions, not a community dose ladder.

## Evidence note

The 3.5-hour value is a model half-life across the studied doses. Predicted subjective intensity is not an observed score for every participant.
