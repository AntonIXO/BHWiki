## Summary

Aniracetam is recorded as a canonical identity from a source-backed OptiHealth candidate. This draft does not assert effects, dosing, safety, or efficacy.

Reddit index evidence: Aniracetam evidence in the index is preclinical: 10–100 mg/kg reduced anxiety-like behavior in mice through cholinergic, serotonergic and dopaminergic interactions; 100 mg/kg reversed sleep-deprivation passive-avoidance deficits in rats; metabolites potentiated AMPA receptors in vitro.

## Description

This page records the source-backed identity label Aniracetam. The import preserves the candidate's aliases and source trail only; molecular structure, pharmacokinetics, effects, dosing, safety, and efficacy remain unestablished here.

Reddit index evidence: No human efficacy or safety study is linked here. Oral human exposure is complicated by rapid first-pass metabolism; the cited animal and in-vitro findings should not be extrapolated directly to supplement use.

## Evidence note

Identity only import: the cited sources support candidate identity provenance, not an evidence review. No biological relationship or clinical claim is asserted.

Reddit index source review: Four PubMed abstracts were retrieved; PMC4123976 was identified for the healthy-mouse study, but rights-eligible full text was not returned in this pass. All structured biological findings are from mice, rats or Xenopus oocytes. Full-text retrieval status is recorded per reference; 1 of 4 PubMed records had a PMC identifier in this set.
