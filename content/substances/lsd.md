## Summary

Lysergic acid diethylamide, recorded here as the (+)-isomer, PubChem CID 5761. A human pharmacokinetic study reports a geometric mean plasma half-life of 2.6 hours after 100 and 200 µg orally.

## Description

This article is the parent compound PubChem titles (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide. A pharmacokinetic study measured plasma concentrations and subjective timing after 100 and 200 µg. A separate study in 16 healthy adults described dose-dependent subjective effects from 25 to 200 µg. A review describes psychedelics as agonists or partial agonists at brain 5-HT2A receptors and names LSD in that class history. Legal status was not assessed: a DEA fact sheet for LSD was not retrieved.

## Evidence note

The half-life is a study geometric mean. Subjective duration in that study is not the plasma half-life. The receptor statement is a class review, not an LSD binding constant.

## Effects

```yaml
- conceptId: perception
  name: Dose-dependent subjective effects
  direction: Increased
  evidence: Human research
  description: Subjective effects were dose-dependent from 25 µg. Good effects reached a ceiling at 100 µg. Across the 25–200 µg range, duration ran from 6.7 to 11 hours.
  sourceId: holze2021
  population: 16 healthy adults
  exposure: Oral LSD 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg
  instrument: null
  magnitude: null
- conceptId: anxiety
  name: Anxiety at the highest studied dose
  direction: Increased
  evidence: Human research
  description: The 200 µg dose produced more ego dissolution and significant anxiety than the lower doses in that study.
  sourceId: holze2021
  population: 16 healthy adults
  exposure: Oral LSD 200 µg, compared with 25–100 µg in the same study
  instrument: null
  magnitude: null

## Outcomes

```yaml
[]
```

## Mechanisms

```yaml
- title: 5-HT2A agonism in a class review
  description: Nichols describes psychedelics as agonists or partial agonists at brain 5-HT2A receptors. LSD is named in that historical class framing.
  sourceId: nichols2016
  conceptId: serotonin-2a
```

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Higher dose, more anxiety
  description: In the 16-person dose-effect study, 200 µg produced more ego dissolution and significant anxiety than the lower doses.
  sourceId: holze2021
```

## Claims

```yaml
- id: lsd-serotonin-2a
  assertion: A review describes psychedelics as agonists or partial agonists at brain 5-HT2A receptors and names LSD in the history of that class.
  relation: receptor-agonism
  participants:
    - entityId: substance:lsd
      role: substance
    - entityId: tag:serotonin-2a
      role: target
    - entityId: tag:serotonin
      role: transmitter
  context: Class review, not an LSD receptor-binding experiment
  sourceIds:
    - nichols2016
  conflictingSourceIds: []
  assessment: not-formally-assessed
  limitation: The statement is class consensus in a review. It is not an LSD binding constant, and a ketanserin outcome from a separate study was not included here.
