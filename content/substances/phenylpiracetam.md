## Summary

Phenylpiracetam/fonturacetam is a racemic prescription drug in the Russian evidence base; R- and S-enantiomer findings are preclinical and must not be substituted for racemate clinical evidence. Human signals concern stroke rehabilitation, epilepsy add-on therapy and asthenia, while healthy-user cognition and athletic enhancement remain unconfirmed. [dr-phenylpiracetam-s1][dr-phenylpiracetam-s20]

## Description

The current Fonturacetam-Akrikhin label describes 100 mg tablets and adult regimens, but label indications are not equivalent to high-certainty randomized evidence. Online products marketed as Phenotropil, phenylpiracetam or R-phenylpiracetam are not assumed to match registered tablets. [dr-phenylpiracetam-s20]

## Evidence note

The strongest evidence-quality limitation is a small, predominantly Russian literature with incomplete design and disclosure reporting. The 2026 healthy-volunteer registry had no posted results at the cutoff; no modern human PK study for racemate or isolated enantiomers was located. [dr-phenylpiracetam-s1][nct07852130]
