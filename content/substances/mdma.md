## Summary

3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, PubChem CID 1615. In a phase 3 trial of severe PTSD, CAPS-5 scores fell further with MDMA plus therapy than with placebo plus the same therapy. The inspected abstract does not state the milligram dose or an elimination half-life.

## Description

This record is the parent compound. The clinical result below comes from one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial in severe PTSD, with manualized therapy and a psychiatric-medication washout. It does not describe unsupervised use. No elimination half-life was in the inspected abstract.

## Evidence note

The severity result belongs to a supervised therapy protocol. The milligram exposure and the elimination half-life were not in the inspected abstract.

## Doses

```yaml
- label: Phase 3 severe-PTSD trial
  amount: Milligram exposure not stated in the inspected abstract
  quantity: null
  quantityMax: null
  unit: mg
  ingredient: MDMA
  formulation: Not stated in the inspected abstract
  route: Not stated in the inspected abstract
  frequency: Not stated in the inspected abstract
  duration: Protocol with 3 preparatory and 9 integrative therapy sessions. The number of MDMA administrations was not in the inspected abstract.
  population: 90 adults with severe PTSD, randomized 1:1 after psychiatric medication washout
  purpose: Compare MDMA-assisted therapy with placebo plus the same manualized therapy (NCT03537014)
  sourceCategory: research
  note: Supervised trial exposure. The abstract does not state a milligram amount.

## Outcomes

```yaml
- conceptId: ptsd-severity
  name: CAPS-5 total severity
  direction: Decreased
  evidence: Human research
  description: Mean CAPS-5 change was -24.4 (SD 11.6) with MDMA plus therapy and -13.9 (SD 11.5) with placebo plus therapy (P<0.0001, d=0.91). The secondary Sheehan Disability Scale also differed (P=0.0116, d=0.43). The abstract reported no adverse events of abuse potential, suicidality, or QT prolongation in that protocol, and described treatment as safe and well tolerated there.
  sourceId: mitchell2021
  population: 90 adults with severe PTSD
  exposure: MDMA or placebo plus manualized therapy after medication washout
  instrument: CAPS-5 primary endpoint
  magnitude: Mean change -24.4 versus -13.9; P<0.0001; d=0.91
```

## Mechanisms

```yaml
[]
```

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Trial safety is protocol-specific
  description: The abstract describes the regimen as safe and well tolerated in that supervised protocol and says MDMA did not induce adverse events of abuse potential, suicidality, or QT prolongation there. That wording does not transfer to unsupervised exposure.
  sourceId: mitchell2021
```

## Claims

```yaml
- id: mdma-ptsd
  assertion: In a supervised phase 3 trial, MDMA plus manualized therapy reduced CAPS-5 PTSD severity more than placebo plus the same therapy.
