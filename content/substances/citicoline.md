## Summary

Citicoline (CDP-choline) is a phosphatidylcholine-pathway intermediate studied as a drug and food ingredient. Large stroke and traumatic-brain-injury trials were negative, while limited cognition trials show endpoint-specific, inconsistent signals.

## Description

Citicoline is CDP-choline, not dietary choline itself: it is a nucleotide containing a choline moiety and a cytidine-derived moiety, and exogenous doses are extensively metabolized. Human studies report rises in circulating choline plus pyrimidine metabolites; later work found uridine, rather than reliably detectable cytidine, after oral dosing.

## Evidence note

Citicoline is a precursor whose oral and intravenous doses generate choline and pyrimidine metabolites; an unchanged-parent half-life is not established. Large stroke and traumatic-brain-injury trials were negative on prespecified global outcomes, while small cognition, visual and TBI studies remain endpoint-specific and mixed. Regulatory permissions and labels are not efficacy evidence.
