## Summary

Salvinorin A, PubChem CID 128563, is described as a selective nonnitrogenous kappa-opioid agonist and the principal constituent of Salvia divinorum. Inhaled microgram-per-kilogram doses in two small studies produced effects that peaked within about 2 minutes.

## Description

This article is the pure compound. It is not a page about the plant or about smoking leaf. Neither inspected abstract reports an elimination half-life. Narrative themes from sessions are not reprinted here.

## Evidence note

Two small inhaled-dose studies support timing and subjective findings. The receptor description comes from the study abstract. No half-life was reported.

## Doses

```yaml
- label: Ascending inhaled doses, four participants
  amount: 0.375–21 µg/kg
  quantity: 0.375
  quantityMax: 21
  unit: µg/kg
  ingredient: Salvinorin A
  formulation: Inhaled study doses
  route: Inhaled
  frequency: Up to 16 ascending doses plus 4 placebos
  duration: Acute laboratory sessions under supportive conditions
  population: 4 healthy adults who had used hallucinogens
  purpose: Human psychopharmacology and dose effects
  sourceCategory: research
  note: Drug strength peaked at 2 minutes. Heart rate and blood pressure did not increase significantly.
  sourceId: johnson2011
- label: Ascending inhaled doses, eight participants
  amount: 0.375–21 µg/kg
  quantity: 0.375
  quantityMax: 21
  unit: µg/kg
  ingredient: Salvinorin A
  formulation: Inhaled study doses
  route: Inhaled
  frequency: Up to 16 ascending doses
  duration: Double-blind placebo-controlled sessions, with 1-month follow-up
  population: 8 healthy adults who had used hallucinogens
  purpose: Dose-related subjective, dissociative, and memory effects
  sourceCategory: research
  note: Effects peaked at 2 minutes and dissipated rapidly. High doses often reached maximal drug strength or unresponsiveness.

## Effects

```yaml
- conceptId: dissociation
  name: Dose-related dissociative effects
  direction: Increased
  evidence: Human research
  description: The eight-person study reported intense subjective effects and dose-related dissociative effects, with some questionnaire overlap with classic hallucinogens. Participants described the effects as qualitatively different from other drugs they had used. Recall and recognition memory were impaired during the session. No persisting adverse effects were found at the 1-month follow-up.
  sourceId: maclean2013
  population: 8 healthy adults who had used hallucinogens
  exposure: Inhaled salvinorin A, 0.375–21 µg/kg
  instrument: null
  magnitude: null

## Outcomes

```yaml
[]
```

## Mechanisms

```yaml
- title: Kappa-opioid agonism
  description: The cited human study describes salvinorin A as a potent selective nonnitrogenous kappa-opioid agonist.
  sourceId: johnson2011
  conceptId: kappa-opioid-receptor
```

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: High doses and responsiveness
  description: In the eight-person study, high doses often produced maximal drug strength or unresponsiveness. Effects in that study peaked at 2 minutes.
  sourceId: maclean2013
- title: Short monitored sessions
  description: The four-person study found no significant increase in heart rate or blood pressure and no definite subjective effects by about 20 minutes. Those observations are limited to that protocol.
  sourceId: johnson2011
```

## Claims

```yaml
- id: salvinorin-kappa
  assertion: Salvinorin A is described as a potent selective nonnitrogenous kappa-opioid agonist and the principal constituent of Salvia divinorum.
  relation: receptor-agonism
  participants:
    - entityId: substance:salvinorin-a
      role: substance
    - entityId: tag:kappa-opioid-receptor
      role: target
