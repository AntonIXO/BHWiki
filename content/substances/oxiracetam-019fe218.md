## Summary

Oxiracetam evidence in the linked publications is preclinical. In cultured neurons, micromolar oxiracetam potentiated AMPA-receptor-mediated calcium influx; in rats, 100–300 mg/kg intraperitoneally increased hippocampal/cortical acetylcholine utilization and improved an active-avoidance deficit. A linked commercial page remains an unverified lead. [reddit-pmid-1372342][reddit-pmid-3594455]

## Description

This page records the source-backed identity label Oxiracetam. The import preserves the candidate's aliases and source trail only; molecular structure, pharmacokinetics, effects, dosing, safety, and efficacy remain unestablished here.

## Evidence note

PubMed abstracts retrieved for PMIDs 1372342 and 3594455; no PMC full text was available. The Reddit-linked commercial EEG page could not be resolved to a PubMed record and remains an explicit unverified lead. The evidence is cell and rat research, not human efficacy or safety evidence.

## Doses

```yaml
- label: Rat cholinergic study
  amount: 100 or 300 mg/kg
  quantity: 100
  quantityMax: 300
  unit: mg/kg
  ingredient: Oxiracetam
  formulation: Experimental oxiracetam
  route: intraperitoneal
  frequency: Single or repeated daily administration
  duration: Acute and repeated exposure; abstract reports repeated daily 100 mg/kg
  population: Rats
  purpose: Preclinical exposure; not a human dosing recommendation.
  note: Oxiracetam 100 mg/kg i.p. antagonized an active-avoidance impairment; 300 mg/kg also increased acetylcholine utilization.

## Mechanisms

```yaml
- title: Positive AMPA modulation
  description: Oxiracetam increased AMPA-mediated calcium influx efficacy and AMPA binding-site density in neuronal preparations; the study did not establish in vivo human mechanism.
  sourceId: reddit-pmid-1372342
- title: Septohippocampal cholinergic enhancement
  description: Rat data indicate increased acetylcholine utilization and high-affinity choline uptake in hippocampus, consistent with enhanced cholinergic pathway activity.
  sourceId: reddit-pmid-3594455
```

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Preclinical evidence only
  description: The linked PubMed studies used cultured neurons or rats; they do not establish human efficacy, dose, pharmacokinetics, or safety.
  sourceId: reddit-pmid-1372342
- title: Unverified commercial EEG link
  description: The Reddit index includes a commercial page about oxiracetam EEG effects, but no PubMed record was identified in this pass; it remains an unverified lead.

```yaml
- id: reddit-claim-oxiracetam-3594455-0
