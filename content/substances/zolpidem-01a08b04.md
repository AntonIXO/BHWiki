## Summary

Zolpidem has 1 linked PubMed publication records in the Reddit Nootropics index. Structured observations below are limited to source-specific abstract results and explicitly identified pharmacokinetic or safety findings.

## Description

This page links the legacy Reddit Nootropics index to 1 retrieved PubMed records out of 1 linked PMID records. Doses, outcomes, mechanisms, cautions, and claims cite the matching publication reference; a PMC link is retained when PubMed supplied one.

## Evidence note

PubMed/PMC review: retrieved 1 PubMed records linked from this Reddit index entry; 1 returned PMCID identifiers. Structured records cite the matching publication reference. Full-text retrieval was attempted for the identified PMC records; unavailable or partial retrieval is left explicit in the citation limitation. Funding and conflicts remain unassessed unless the source record reports them.

PMC full-text retrieval for this page returned body text for 1/1 identified PMCID records; 0 returned no retrievable body or a tool error.

  name: Reaction Time
  direction: Increased
  evidence: Human research
  description: The method was found to produce low variability with coefficient of variation less than 10%. Interday reproducibility was very good as shown by Bland-Altman plot with most of the values within ±2SD. There was a significant increase in RTs in Stroop performance with Zolpidem at 1 hr and 2 hrs; in contrast, caffeine significantly decreased RTs in Stroop performance at 1 hr only compared to placebo. The Stroop color-word recording and analysis system is simple, sensitive to centrally acting drug effects, and has potential for future experimental psychomotor assessment studies.
  sourceId: reddit-pmid-24049230
  population: 24 healthy participants using computerized version of Stroop color-word test
  exposure: The standardized method was followed in all cases, by recording the reaction time (RT) in msec in 24 healthy participants using computerized version of Stroop color-word test. Reproducibility of the test procedure was evaluated by recording the RTs by a single experimenter on two sessions (interday reproducibility). Validity of the model was further tested by evaluating the psychotropic effect of Zolpidem 5 mg, Caffeine 500 mg, or Placebo on 24 healthy subjects in a randomized, double blind thre
