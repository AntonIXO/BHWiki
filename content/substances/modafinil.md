## Summary

S. for narcolepsy, residual OSA sleepiness and diagnosed shift-work disorder.

## Description

The U.S. label uses 200 mg once daily for narcolepsy and OSA or about one hour before a diagnosed night shift; it treats residual sleepiness, not airway obstruction or ordinary fatigue. [dr-modafinil-link-1]

## Evidence note

Study findings and methods are linked to their original publications.

## Pharmacokinetics

```yaml
- id: modafinil-pk-1
  analyte: Modafinil (R/S racemate)
  route: Oral
  formulation: Immediate-release tablet
  population: Healthy adults and labeled patient populations
  endpoint: elimination-half-life
  statistic: approximate
  value: 15
  low: null
  high: null
  unit: hours
  context: Effective multiple-dose half-life is approximately 15 hours; R-modafinil persists about three times longer than S-modafinil. Food delays Tmax by about one hour without materially changing overall exposure.
  sourceId: dr-modafinil-link-1
  modelEligible: false
```

## Modifiers

```yaml
- label: Hepatic impairment
  effect: Exposure increases
  detail: Advanced cirrhosis lowers clearance by about 60% and approximately doubles steady-state concentration; the label recommends half dosing in severe hepatic impairment.
  sourceId: dr-modafinil-link-1
  observationId: modafinil-pk-1
  factorType: other
  direction: slower
- label: CYP3A4/5 induction
  effect: Co-medication exposure can fall
  detail: The label documents lower exposure to steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam and triazolam.
