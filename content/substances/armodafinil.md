## Summary

Armodafinil is the isolated R-enantiomer of modafinil. Direct evidence supports wakefulness in narcolepsy, residual OSA sleepiness and diagnosed shift-work disorder; a broad healthy-person cognitive-enhancement effect was not established. Equal milligram doses are not equivalent to racemic modafinil. [dr-r1][dr-r2]

## Description

The U.S. NUVIGIL label uses 150–250 mg each morning for narcolepsy or residual OSA sleepiness and 150 mg before a diagnosed night shift. It does not treat airway obstruction, ordinary sleep loss or general productivity. [dr-r1]

## Evidence note

The strongest evidence is condition-specific wakefulness and pharmacokinetics. Serious rash, psychiatric effects, cardiovascular monitoring, misuse/dependence, CYP interactions and combined modafinil/armodafinil pregnancy data remain important limits. [dr-r1][dr-r19]

## Pharmacokinetics

```yaml
- id: armodafinil-pk-1
  analyte: Armodafinil (R-modafinil)
  route: Oral
  formulation: NUVIGIL tablet
  population: Healthy adults
  endpoint: elimination-half-life
  statistic: approximate
  value: 15
  low: null
  high: null
  unit: hours
  context: Pooled randomized PK studies found approximately linear exposure from 50–400 mg, fasted Tmax around two hours and steady state around seven days; food delays Tmax by roughly 2–4 hours.
  sourceId: dr-r16
  modelEligible: false
```

## Modifiers

```yaml
- label: CYP3A4/5 induction
  effect: Substrate exposure can fall
  detail: Clinical interaction studies found lower midazolam and quetiapine exposure and the label warns about steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine and related substrates.
  sourceId: dr-r17
  observationId: armodafinil-pk-1
  factorType: enzyme
  direction: variable
- label: CYP2C19 inhibition
  effect: Substrate exposure can rise
  detail: Armodafinil increased omeprazole exposure and can affect phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol and clomipramine.
