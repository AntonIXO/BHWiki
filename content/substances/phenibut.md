## Summary

Phenibut is a synthetic GABA analogue with prescription use in some post-Soviet settings and substantial nonmedical online exposure. WHO and the systematic-review evidence do not establish moderate- or high-certainty efficacy; toxicity, dependence and withdrawal signals are better documented than healthy-person benefit. [dr-phenibut-s1][kupats2020]

## Description

Clinical studies concern adjustment disorder, headache, facial pain, ADHD, vascular disease and fatigue rather than healthy enhancement. Product salt, formulation and dose accuracy vary across Noofen prescriptions and online phenibut products. [dr-phenibut-s2][dr-phenibut-s7]

## Evidence note

No adequate healthy-volunteer efficacy trial or modern human PK study was identified. Published poison-center and case-series data document CNS depression, coma/airway support, agitation, psychosis, tolerance, dependence and severe withdrawal, while incidence cannot be inferred from passive or case-selected datasets. [dr-phenibut-s16][dr-phenibut-s20]

## Modifiers

```yaml

  effect: Evidence is not interchangeable
  detail: Noofen/Noophen hydrochloride capsules and online phenibut powders or salts should not be assumed equivalent in identity, dose accuracy or clinical evidence.

## Mechanisms

```yaml
- title: GABAergic analogue
  description: WHO supports GABA_B and α2δ-related pharmacology mainly from nonhuman or in-vitro evidence; the often-repeated GABA_A claim was not adequately substantiated.
  sourceId: dr-phenibut-s1
```

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Dependence and withdrawal
  description: Published withdrawal cases include seizures, intubation and ICU admission; all were case-based and publication-selected, so percentages describe the case series rather than average-user risk.
  sourceId: feldman2023
- title: CNS depression and coma
  description: Poison-center and toxicity reviews document somnolence, psychosis, altered mental status, coma and airway intervention, with common coexposures.
  sourceId: dr-phenibut-s16
- title: Pregnancy, renal and hepatic evidence gaps
  description: No adequate human pregnancy, lactation, renal-impairment or hepatic-impairment studies were identified.
  sourceId: dr-phenibut-s1
```
