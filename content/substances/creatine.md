## Summary

An endogenous compound used in muscle energy metabolism. Supplementation reliably raises muscle creatine stores, while evidence for cognitive enhancement is context-dependent and not established for healthy, well-rested young adults. [2018 systematic review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29704637/) [2024 EFSA assessment](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2903/j.efsa.2024.9100)

## Description

Creatine is better understood through tissue stores and repeated supplementation than through an immediate subjective effect. Research on training outcomes and research on cognition ask different questions and should not share a single benefit score. A 2023 memory meta-analysis reported a small overall effect concentrated in older adults, while controlled trials in young rested adults were mostly null. [2023 memory meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35984306/) [young-adult trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18579168/)

## Evidence note

This article covers muscle stores, exercise, and the tested cognitive contexts of normal rest, older age, and acute sleep deprivation. The cognitive findings are heterogeneous, and the meta-analytic estimates are sensitive to correlated-test counting; they do not establish creatine as a general nootropic. A 2026 review likewise argues that physiological plausibility has not translated into convincing or consistently interpretable clinical cognitive evidence. [2026 methodological commentary](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2026.1716285/full) [Machado 2026](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/42912797/)
