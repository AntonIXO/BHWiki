kinetics:
  onset: Plasma choline rises within the first post-dose hours after oral choline bitartrate, but a validated pharmacokinetic onset threshold is not established.
  peak: Healthy-person studies reported plasma free-choline peaks around 1 hour after 600 mg choline supplied as bitartrate and a median 1.75 hours after 1336 mg choline bitartrate supplying 550 mg choline.
  duration: In one 6-hour crossover study, plasma free choline after choline bitartrate was no longer different from no-choline control at 6 hours; a separate study sampled through 24 hours. These are observation windows, not elimination half-lives.
  bioavailability: Oral choline bitartrate increases circulating choline, but systemic exposure differs by formulation and study; free versus phospholipid-bound choline also differs substantially in gut conversion to TMAO.
  metabolism: Released choline can enter phosphatidylcholine and acetylcholine pathways, be oxidized to betaine, or undergo gut-microbial conversion to trimethylamine followed by hepatic oxidation to trimethylamine N-oxide.

## Summary

Choline bitartrate is a hygroscopic 1:1 choline/L-hydrogen-tartrate salt containing about 41.1% choline by mass. Human evidence shows no acute memory benefit in healthy young adults, a visuomotor speed–accuracy shift, and reproducible choline/TMAO exposure effects; disease-population findings do not establish healthy-person cognitive enhancement.

## Description

Choline bitartrate (CAS 87-67-2; PubChem CID 6900) is the 1:1 choline/L-(+)-hydrogen-tartrate salt, with about 41.1% choline-equivalent by mass in the pure anhydrous form. FCC describes a white hygroscopic crystalline powder, freely water-soluble, slightly alcohol-soluble, and ether/chloroform-insoluble. PubChem compiles manufacturing and legacy identity/assay methods; finished-product moisture and excipients can change delivered salt mass.

## Evidence note

Human evidence is split between formulation-specific choline/TMAO kinetics, null or narrowly positive healthy-person task results, and specialized pediatric FASD studies. Salt mass must be separated from choline-equivalent mass; no validated bitartrate or released-choline half-life is established.

## Mechanisms

```yaml
- title: Choline precursor and structural-lipid pathways
  description: Choline released from choline bitartrate can supply substrate for acetylcholine synthesis, phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin metabolism, and oxidation to betaine. Precursor availability alone does not demonstrate increased brain acetylcholine or cognitive benefit after this formulation.
  sourceId: pubchem
  conceptId: choline-precursor
- title: Gut-microbial trimethylamine and hepatic TMAO formation
  description: Unabsorbed or gut-accessible free choline can be converted by intestinal microbes to trimethylamine, which is oxidized primarily by hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenase activity to TMAO. Choline-bitartrate TMAO responses vary markedly among individuals and with microbiome composition.
  sourceId: cho-2020
```

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Salt mass is not choline-equivalent
  description: Pure anhydrous choline bitartrate is about 41.1% choline by mass. Product moisture, assay and excipients can change delivered choline; trial salt doses cannot be copied as universal choline targets.
  sourceId: pubchem
- title: Excess-choline adverse effects
  description: NIH guidance for total choline lists fishy body odor, vomiting, sweating, salivation, hypotension and liver toxicity at excessive intake. This is a nutrient-level warning, not bitartrate-specific incidence evidence.
  sourceId: ods-2022
- title: Pediatric FASD evidence is specialized
  description: FASD studies are narrow pediatric disease-population trials. Fishy body odor was the reproducible treatment-attributed event, and attrition-prone follow-up does not establish durable general benefit.
  sourceId: wozniak-2025
- title: TMAO is an intermediate biomarker
  description: Several bitartrate studies raise TMAO, but they were not powered for myocardial infarction, stroke, thrombosis or mortality; renal-function and gut-microbiome context affect interpretation.

  insight: Four-week choline-bitartrate arms markedly increased fasting TMAO and platelet responsiveness, whereas egg-only and phosphatidylcholine-only arms did not.
  limitation: Biomarkers were measured rather than cardiovascular events; intervention arms were modest and differed in dietary matrix.

  title: "Choline enhances elicited imitation memory performance in preschool children with prenatal alcohol exposure: a cumulative report of 3 randomized controlled trials"
  authors: Jeffrey R. Wozniak, Judith K. Eckerle, Blake A. Gimbel, Abigail M. Ernst, Mary E. Anthony, Kent A. Tuominen, Erik de Water, Steven H. Zeisel, Michael K. Georgieff
  year: 2025
  url: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12002193/
  kind: Cumulative report of human randomized placebo-controlled trials
  insight: Nine-month choline treatment improved an elicited-imitation sequential-memory measure in young children with prenatal alcohol exposure, but not executive function or IQ.
  limitation: Disease-risk developmental population and pooled three-trial analysis; findings cannot be transferred to healthy-adult cognitive enhancement.

  title: "Oral Choline Reduced Working Memory-Related Brain Activation in Postmenopausal Women: A Pilot Study"
  authors: Julie A. Dumas, Abigail Testo, Anna Senft Miller, Angeles Ozahl, Callum Potts, Jiming Zhang, Marwa Aboukhatwa, James Boyd
  year: 2026
  url: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12899796/
  kind: Human randomized placebo-controlled crossover pilot study
  insight: Acute choline bitartrate altered working-memory-related fMRI activation and connectivity but did not significantly improve working-memory performance.
  limitation: Small pilot, retrospectively registered, single dose; its statement that 1650 mg bitartrate delivers 1650 mg choline cation conflicts with molecular composition.
  pmid: "41683281"
  doi: 10.3390/nu18030459
  funding: The study reported an investigator-initiated grant from Balchem Corporation; the authors stated that the funder had no role in study conduct or reporting.

  year: 2026
  url: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC13398441/
  kind: Human randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover studies
  insight: Acute and four-week choline bitartrate markedly raised TMAO without materially worsening primary measures of insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance.
  limitation: Small, mostly young healthy population; treatment lasted at most four weeks and TMAO responses were highly heterogeneous.
