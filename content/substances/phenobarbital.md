## Summary

Phenobarbital is a long-acting barbiturate CNS depressant and antiseizure medicine. Its identity is PubChem CID 4763, C12H12N2O3, 232.23 g/mol. In current U.S. regulatory records, SEZABY phenobarbital sodium injection is an NDA-approved Schedule IV product indicated for neonatal seizures in term and preterm infants, while a current oral phenobarbital tablet SPL lists generalized and partial seizures as anticonvulsant indications but DailyMed identifies that tablet record's approval type as "unapproved drug other." [pubchem][dailymed-sezaby][fda-sezaby-approval][dailymed-phenobarbital-tablets]

Phenobarbital has unusually long elimination relative to its label-described 10–12-hour pharmacologic duration: the oral label reports an adult plasma half-life of 53–118 hours, mean 79 hours, while neonatal elimination can approach a week and varies with maturation and critical-care factors. Its clinically important liabilities include sedation, respiratory depression, accumulation, enzyme induction, multiple drug interactions, tolerance, physical dependence and potentially life-threatening withdrawal after prolonged exposure. [dailymed-phenobarbital-tablets][dailymed-sezaby][thibault2021]

## Description

Phenobarbital is 5-ethyl-5-phenylbarbituric acid and acts as a barbiturate CNS depressant. The current neonatal prescribing information states that its precise antiseizure mechanism is not fully understood but is thought to involve potentiation of synaptic inhibition through GABAA receptors. Phenobarbital also induces hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes; controlled healthy-volunteer work demonstrates increased metabolic clearance of a probe drug after repeated phenobarbital exposure, supporting clinically meaningful enzyme induction in humans. [dailymed-sezaby][dailymed-phenobarbital-tablets][thompson1996]

The evidence base needs regulatory context. SEZABY received U.S. marketing approval on November 17, 2022 for treatment of neonatal seizures in term and preterm infants. Its current label uses intravenous loading followed by short maintenance treatment and includes a boxed warning for concomitant opioid use as well as warnings about dependence and withdrawal when treatment is extended beyond the recommended neonatal course. Current oral phenobarbital tablet labeling describes anticonvulsant use in generalized and partial seizures, but the particular DailyMed tablet record cited here is not presented as an FDA-approved NDA product. [fda-sezaby-approval][dailymed-sezaby][dailymed-phenobarbital-tablets]

## Evidence note

Patient-treatment evidence, healthy-volunteer measurements, pharmacokinetic measurements, and subjective experience are kept separate here. The strongest contemporary neonatal efficacy result used is the blinded NEOLEV2 randomized trial: among its modified intention-to-treat participants, 24-hour EEG-confirmed seizure freedom occurred in 80% of phenobarbital-assigned neonates versus 28% of levetiracetam-assigned neonates, although the phenobarbital arm was small and the investigators explicitly called for definitive studies with long-term outcomes. The subsequently approved SEZABY indication and dosage are taken from current U.S. prescribing information rather than inferred from that trial alone. [sharpe2020][ctgov-neolev2][dailymed-sezaby]

Healthy-volunteer evidence cited here addresses pharmacokinetics and enzyme induction, not therapeutic efficacy. A seven-person crossover study measured approximately 112–113-hour half-lives after intramuscular and rectal phenobarbital sodium, while a separate controlled volunteer study demonstrated enzyme induction during repeated oral exposure. Neither primary study supplies a validated participant-rated "felt duration" estimate. Accordingly, the oral label's 10–12-hour "duration of action" is not treated as a subjective experiential duration, and the multi-day serum half-life is not treated as the length of consciously perceived drug effects. [graves1989][thompson1996][dailymed-phenobarbital-tablets]

Therapeutic drug monitoring is context-dependent rather than reducible here to one universal concentration target. The current oral label directs clinicians to use clinical-laboratory reference values for therapeutic anticonvulsant levels; a specialized ECMO pharmacokinetic study used 20–40 mg/L as its study target and strongly recommended monitoring during renal replacement therapy. That specialized target is therefore preserved as a study-specific goal rather than generalized to every patient. [dailymed-phenobarbital-tablets][thibault2021]

## Modifiers

```yaml
- label: Neonatal age and maturation
  effect: Elimination is generally slower and more variable early in life than in adults.
  detail: The adult tablet-label mean half-life is 79 hours, whereas its children/newborn grouping has a mean of 110 hours and the current neonatal label summarizes an approximately one-week neonatal half-life. The neonatal label links prolonged elimination partly to negligible CYP2C9 expression at birth.
  sourceId: dailymed-sezaby
  observationId: phenobarbital-pk-neonatal-sezaby
  factorType: other
  direction: slower
- label: Renal impairment
  effect: Dose requirements may change, but the magnitude is not defined by the current cited labels.
  detail: The oral label states that dosage should be reduced in impaired renal function, while the neonatal label says the effect of renal impairment on neonatal phenobarbital pharmacokinetics is unknown. These statements should not be converted into an unsupported numerical adjustment.
  sourceId: dailymed-phenobarbital-tablets
  observationId: phenobarbital-pk-adult-label
  factorType: other
  direction: variable
- label: Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration during ECMO
  effect: Phenobarbital clearance can increase markedly.
  detail: In a retrospective population-PK study of 35 neonates and infants on ECMO, the five children receiving CVVHDF had model-estimated clearance about 6.2-fold higher than children without renal replacement therapy. The authors emphasized the small RRT sample and recommended therapeutic drug monitoring rather than uncritical extrapolation of the model.
  sourceId: thibault2021
  observationId: phenobarbital-pk-neonatal-sezaby
  factorType: other
  direction: faster
- label: Hepatic disease
  effect: Reduced dosing and greater caution may be required; marked liver impairment is a contraindication in the cited oral label.
  detail: The oral label advises reduced initial doses in hepatic damage and identifies marked liver impairment as a contraindication. The current neonatal label does not quantify how hepatic impairment changes neonatal exposure.
  sourceId: dailymed-phenobarbital-tablets
  observationId: phenobarbital-pk-adult-label
  factorType: other
  direction: variable
- label: Pregnancy
  effect: Pregnancy materially changes the fetal and neonatal risk context, while a quantitative pregnancy-specific phenobarbital clearance change is not established in the current sources used here.
  detail: Phenobarbital crosses the placenta; current labeling warns of fetal harm and neonatal sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia or withdrawal after maternal exposure. These safety findings are not evidence for a specific pregnancy half-life correction.
  sourceId: dailymed-sezaby
  observationId: phenobarbital-pk-adult-label
  factorType: pregnancy
  direction: variable
- label: Therapeutic hypothermia in neonates
  effect: No clinically significant phenobarbital PK difference is identified by the current neonatal label.
  detail: SEZABY labeling states that there are no clinically significant pharmacokinetic differences in neonates administered therapeutic hypothermia; this is a null modifier finding rather than evidence that every critically ill neonate has identical exposure.
  sourceId: dailymed-sezaby
  observationId: phenobarbital-pk-neonatal-sezaby
  factorType: other
  direction: variable
- label: Metabolic inhibitors and inducers
  effect: Phenobarbital exposure can change in either direction.
  detail: The neonatal label identifies phenobarbital as a substrate of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 and UGT pathways and expects inhibitors to raise and inducers to lower exposure, while noting that dedicated neonatal interaction studies have not quantified these effects.

## Mechanisms

```yaml
- title: GABAA-mediated synaptic inhibition
  conceptId: gaba-a
  description: The current neonatal label states that the precise antiseizure mechanism is not fully understood but is thought to involve potentiation of synaptic inhibition through an action at the GABAA receptor. This should not be presented as a complete explanation of every clinical effect.
  sourceId: dailymed-sezaby
- title: Hepatic enzyme induction
  conceptId: enzyme-induction
  description: Phenobarbital induces drug-metabolizing pathways including CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C enzymes and UGT activity. Healthy-volunteer probe-drug data independently demonstrate increased metabolic clearance during repeated phenobarbital treatment.
  sourceId: thompson1996
- title: Long persistence and accumulation
  conceptId: elimination-half-life
  description: Multi-day elimination half-lives mean serum phenobarbital can persist and accumulate well beyond the oral label's 10–12-hour duration-of-action statement; dose timing, steady state and withdrawal therefore cannot be inferred from felt sedation alone.
  sourceId: dailymed-phenobarbital-tablets
```

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Respiratory depression and overdose
  description: Phenobarbital is a dose-dependent respiratory depressant. Severe overdose can progress to marked CNS depression, coma, hypotension, respiratory or circulatory collapse and death; suspected overdose is a medical emergency rather than a situation for self-management.
  sourceId: dailymed-phenobarbital-tablets
- title: Opioid combination risk
  description: The current SEZABY boxed warning states that concomitant phenobarbital and opioid use can cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death; when such coadministration is clinically necessary, the label calls for limiting exposure and close monitoring.
  sourceId: dailymed-sezaby
- title: Tolerance, physical dependence and withdrawal
  description: Tolerance and physical dependence can develop with repeated phenobarbital exposure. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dose reduction after dependence has developed can provoke severe and potentially life-threatening withdrawal, including seizures and delirium; prolonged therapy therefore requires clinician-directed tapering rather than abrupt cessation.
  sourceId: dailymed-phenobarbital-tablets
- title: Dependence risk after extending neonatal treatment
  description: SEZABY's recommended neonatal course is short; its boxed warning specifically notes dependence and withdrawal reactions when phenobarbital is used for longer than recommended and warns against abrupt discontinuation after extended exposure.
  sourceId: dailymed-sezaby
- title: Pregnancy and neonatal exposure
  description: Phenobarbital crosses the placenta and current labeling warns that maternal exposure can harm the fetus. Late-pregnancy exposure can also produce neonatal sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia or withdrawal; pregnancy therefore changes the risk-benefit and monitoring context even though a quantitative pregnancy-specific PK correction is not established here.
  sourceId: dailymed-sezaby
- title: Serious cutaneous and systemic hypersensitivity
  description: Current labeling includes serious dermatologic reactions and multiorgan hypersensitivity including DRESS; clinically significant rash or systemic hypersensitivity requires urgent medical assessment.
  sourceId: dailymed-sezaby
- title: Liver, kidney, respiratory disease and porphyria
  description: The cited oral label contraindicates phenobarbital in marked liver impairment, manifest or latent porphyria and respiratory disease with dyspnea or obstruction, and advises lower dosing in impaired renal function or hepatic disease.
  sourceId: dailymed-phenobarbital-tablets
- title: Therapeutic drug monitoring is contextual
  description: Phenobarbital's long and variable half-life, age effects and interaction burden make serum concentrations useful in selected clinical contexts. The oral label directs interpretation against clinical-laboratory reference values, while specialized ECMO/RRT research strongly recommends TDM; the 20–40 mg/L research target used in that ECMO study is not treated here as a universal therapeutic range.

- id: phenobarbital-opioids
  name: Opioids
  otherSlug: null
  summary: Concomitant use can produce profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death. SEZABY carries a boxed warning directing clinicians to reserve such combinations for situations in which alternatives are inadequate, minimize exposure and monitor closely.
  sourceId: dailymed-sezaby
  mechanism: Additive CNS and respiratory depression
  context: Current U.S. boxed warning
  severity:
    label: Boxed-warning interaction
    sourceId: dailymed-sezaby
  conflictingSourceIds: []
- id: phenobarbital-alcohol
  name: Alcohol
  otherSlug: null
  summary: Alcohol can add to phenobarbital's CNS-depressant effects; the oral label warns against alcohol and other CNS depressants because additive depression can occur.
  sourceId: dailymed-phenobarbital-tablets
  mechanism: Additive CNS depression
  context: Current U.S. oral labeling
  conflictingSourceIds: []
- id: phenobarbital-valproate
  name: Valproate / valproic acid
  otherSlug: null
  summary: Valproate can increase phenobarbital serum concentrations. Current oral labeling calls for phenobarbital level monitoring and dosage adjustment when needed rather than assuming unchanged exposure.
  sourceId: dailymed-phenobarbital-tablets
  mechanism: Inhibition of phenobarbital elimination
  context: Label-described antiseizure-medication interaction
  conflictingSourceIds: []
- id: phenobarbital-phenytoin
  name: Phenytoin
  otherSlug: null
  summary: "The interaction is explicitly variable in the oral phenobarbital label: some reports describe accelerated phenytoin metabolism while others report no effect. The label therefore recommends more frequent concentration monitoring when the drugs are used together."
  sourceId: dailymed-phenobarbital-tablets
  mechanism: Enzyme induction with reported interindividual or study variability
  context: Conflicting label-described observations are preserved rather than collapsed into a single direction.
  conflictingSourceIds:
    - dailymed-phenobarbital-tablets
- id: phenobarbital-carbamazepine
  name: Carbamazepine
  otherSlug: null
  summary: Current carbamazepine labeling lists phenobarbital among CYP3A4 inducers shown or expected to decrease carbamazepine plasma concentrations by increasing its metabolism.
  sourceId: dailymed-carbamazepine

  kind: Primary healthy-volunteer controlled pharmacology study
  pmid: "8923333"
  doi: 10.1021/js950443e
  insight: In a 48-volunteer parallel study, the phenobarbital group received 30 mg every 6 hours for 17 days and showed increased antipyrine total/nonrenal clearance and 6-beta-hydroxycortisol excretion with a shortened antipyrine half-life, directly demonstrating enzyme induction in humans.
  limitation: The study was designed around mixed-function oxidase probe endpoints rather than seizure treatment, phenobarbital therapeutic efficacy or subjective effects; participants were healthy men and exposure was short-term.
  funding: Specific study funding was not explicitly reported in the accessible article metadata inspected for this draft; author affiliations included Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals.
