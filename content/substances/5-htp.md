## Summary

5-HTP is recorded as a canonical identity from a source-backed OptiHealth candidate. This draft does not assert effects, dosing, safety, or efficacy.

## Description

This page records the source-backed identity label 5-HTP. The import preserves the candidate's aliases and source trail only; molecular structure, pharmacokinetics, effects, dosing, safety, and efficacy remain unestablished here.

## Evidence note

Identity only import: the cited sources support candidate identity provenance, not an evidence review. No biological relationship or clinical claim is asserted.

Reddit index corpus import (6 linked source records; 5 PubMed abstracts). Full-text methods, funding, and conflicts remain unassessed where the source record says so.

## Mechanisms

- title: Source-specific finding from PMID 23609610
  description: 'OBJECTIVE: Several studies have suggested that exogenous administration of the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) can result in the ectopic production of serotonin in dopaminergic neurons and a concomitant reduction in dopamine release.'

- title: Source-specific finding from PMID 20737522
  description: 'OBJECTIVE: Although the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is marketed as a psychoactive nutritional supplement, knowledge is limited regarding the effects of exogenous 5-HTP on brain activity.'
  sourceId: reddit-pmid-20737522
- title: Source-specific finding from PMID 21440001
  description: Carcinoid heart disease was one of the first valvular pathologies studied in molecular detail, and early research identified serotonin produced by oncogenic enterochromaffin cells as the likely culprit in causing changes in heart valve tissue.
