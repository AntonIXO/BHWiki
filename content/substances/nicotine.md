## Summary

Nicotine is the dependence-producing pharmacological agent in tobacco. It activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and can produce small, task-dependent acute attention effects, but evidence does not establish reliable enhancement of memory, athletic performance, mood, sleep, longevity or dementia outcomes in healthy nonusers. Combustible tobacco adds toxicants and disease risks that should not be assigned to nicotine alone; medicinal nicotine-replacement products are safer than continued smoking but remain physiologically active and dependence-forming (benowitz2009; benowitz2010; majdi2021; pasetes2020; fda-nicotine).

## Description

The naturally occurring active enantiomer is (S)-nicotine. Pulmonary delivery produces rapid arterial exposure, while gum, lozenges and patches produce slower peaks. Nicotine is metabolized mainly by CYP2A6 to cotinine; pregnancy, age, genotype, renal or hepatic impairment, meals, menthol and some co-exposures can alter clearance (pubchem; benowitz2009). Cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide, particulates, oxidants, aldehydes and tobacco-specific nitrosamines in addition to nicotine. NRT delivers nicotine without combustion toxicants and is used to reduce withdrawal during smoking cessation (fda-nicotine; fda-cessation).

## Evidence note

PubMed abstracts retrieved for all 49 linked PMIDs. Full-text retrieval was attempted for every PMCID-resolved record; successful responses and connector errors are identified in the individual reference limitations. No-PMC articles remain abstract-only. Existing source-specific records are retained. Evidence spans reviews, human trials, animal studies, and mechanistic papers; nicotine cognitive effects are heterogeneous and dependence/safety risks remain material.

## Cautions

```yaml
- title: Dependence and loss of control
  description: Nicotine can produce tolerance, craving, cue-reactivity, compulsive use and withdrawal even without tobacco smoke; faster delivery and higher peaks generally increase reinforcement.
  sourceId: benowitz2010
- title: Acute toxicity
  description: Excess exposure can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, weakness, sweating, palpitations, tachycardia, confusion and hypotension at severe toxicity.
  sourceId: dailymed-patch
- title: Cardiovascular disease
  description: Nicotine raises heart rate and blood pressure. OTC labels advise clinician review for recent myocardial infarction, serious arrhythmia, worsening angina and uncontrolled hypertension.
  sourceId: dailymed-patch
- title: Pregnancy and adolescence
  description: Nicotine crosses the placenta and enters breast milk; developmental exposure is a public-health concern. NRT decisions during pregnancy are formulation-, adherence- and patient-specific when the alternative is continued smoking.
  sourceId: claire2020
- title: Sleep and product confusion
  description: Overnight patches can cause vivid dreams and insomnia. Evidence for medicinal NRT cannot be transferred directly to cigarettes, high-delivery e-cigarettes, pouches or smokeless tobacco.

## Interactions

```yaml
- id: smoke-cyp1a2
  name: Smoking cessation and CYP1A2 substrates
  otherSlug: null
  targetClassId: stimulant
  summary: Combustible smoke induces CYP1A2; stopping smoking can raise concentrations of clozapine, olanzapine, theophylline, caffeine and some other medicines. This interaction is caused primarily by smoke, not nicotine replacement.
  sourceId: schaffer2009
  mechanism: Reversal of smoke-induced hepatic CYP1A2 induction
  context: Transition from combustible smoking to abstinence or NRT
- id: additive-sympathomimetic
  name: Nicotine with other stimulants or sympathomimetics
  otherSlug: null
  targetClassId: stimulant
  summary: Additive increases in heart rate, blood pressure, tremor, palpitations or anxiety are pharmacologically plausible; direct quantitative interaction data are limited.
  sourceId: najem2006
  mechanism: Pharmacodynamic sympathetic stimulation
  context: Product- and dose-specific
- id: multiple-nicotine-products
  name: Concurrent nicotine products
  otherSlug: null
  summary: Simultaneous cigarette, vape, pouch and NRT use can increase total nicotine exposure and make nausea, dizziness and palpitations more likely; no universal combined safe exposure is established.
