## Summary

A stimulant medicine with formulation-dependent delivery. ADHD treatment findings and attention-task results should retain their population and exposure context.

## Description

Methylphenidate is used in clinical treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy. It inhibits catecholamine reuptake, including dopamine transporters. The displayed structure is the parent compound; study and labeled products commonly contain its hydrochloride salt.

## Evidence note

PubMed abstracts for all 22 linked PMIDs were retrieved; heuristic Reddit-derived records were replaced with source-specific summaries while curated label, DAT-occupancy, and TBI records were retained. Full text was unavailable for the Reddit-linked PMC records in this pass.
