## Summary

Haloperidol is recorded as a canonical identity from a source-backed OptiHealth candidate. This draft does not assert effects, dosing, safety, or efficacy.

## Description

This page records the source-backed identity label Haloperidol. The import preserves the candidate's aliases and source trail only; molecular structure, pharmacokinetics, effects, dosing, safety, and efficacy remain unestablished here.

## Evidence note

Identity only import: the cited sources support candidate identity provenance, not an evidence review. No biological relationship or clinical claim is asserted.

Reddit index corpus import (2 linked source records; 2 PubMed abstracts). Full-text methods, funding, and conflicts remain unassessed where the source record says so.

PubMed MCP abstract review: 2 linked PubMed identifiers were retrieved for this Reddit-index entry; structured fields below are limited to abstract-supported findings. PMC full text was used where rights-eligible and available; remaining methods, funding, and conflicts are unassessed.

PubMed MCP abstract review covered 2 PMID-linked records for this Reddit-index entry. Structured fields are limited to abstract-supported findings; PMC full text was retrieved where rights-eligible and available, with remaining methods, funding, and conflicts unassessed.
