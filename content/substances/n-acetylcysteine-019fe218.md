## Summary

N-Acetylcysteine is recorded as a canonical identity from a source-backed OptiHealth candidate. This draft does not assert effects, dosing, safety, or efficacy.

## Description

This page records the source-backed identity label N-Acetylcysteine. The import preserves the candidate's aliases and source trail only; molecular structure, pharmacokinetics, effects, dosing, safety, and efficacy remain unestablished here.

## Evidence note

PubMed abstracts retrieved for all six linked PMIDs. PMC full text was retrieved for PMIDs 23372680 (PMC3553161), 24740427 (PMC3989181), 24224042 (PMC3818243), and 25581647 (PMC4293075); the remaining two PMIDs had no PMC match. Existing dose, outcome, mechanism, and caution records are retained as source-specific; full-text continuation and disclosures remain incomplete where retrieval was truncated.
